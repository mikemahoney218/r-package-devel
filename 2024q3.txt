Hi,

I have been maintaining packages in R-Forge for many tears. Last week I 
sent an email to r-forge at r-project.org to report problems with the build 
process. It appears that any changes I have pushed to R-Forge over 
approximately the last two months have resulted in the package remaining 
in the "Building" state, even though the logs suggest that the package 
built successfully on both LINUX and Windows. (Also, four of the six 
affected packages only included changes to the man pages to clean up 
NOTEs from the R cmd checks on old versions at CRAN, where the new 
versions now happily reside.) I have received no response nor 
acknowledgement to my email to R-Forge.

Assuming that R-Forge has finally succumbed to the ravages of entropy, 
does anyone have advice on creating a git project that contains multiple 
R packages? (I really don't want to have to create 20+ new git projects, 
one per package).

Best,
 ?? Kevin

Kevin,

I can't speak to whether R-Forge is dead, we migrated our projects to
github a long time ago.

The most straightforward answer for R packages in git repositories is
to use separate git projects.  we were even able to import the entire
SVN history and r-forge issue history to github for each of our r-forge
projects when we migrated. The only major complexity that I recall was
creating a table mapping svn contributors to github users (where
available).

If you want to do it all in one git repository, I strongly suggest that
you *still* import all the svn history, but that you do it in one
directory per project, since this is required by `R CMD build`.  We
sometimes use this 'one package per directory' approach in some of our
private repositories at work.  In this case, if you use an IDE like
RStudio, you'll still create separate *RStudio* projects in each
directory, so that you can build, install, test, etc each package from
the IDE, but you can use a single repository for all of it.

Your future self will thank you for having full version control history
of all the "Olde" (tm) versions.

Best of luck.  - Brian

   I don't know about R-forge, but it's perfectly workable to put 
multiple packages within a single repo, with each package in its own 
subdirectory.  You'll run into some headaches occasionally with (e.g.) 
CI machinery that assumes that the head of a git repo is also the 
primary package directory (e.g. 
https://github.com/r-hub/rhub/issues/584) ...

While you can put multiple packages in one Git repository, I'd suggest 
that you don't do that.  Most packages are in their own repository, and 
that means that users who want to contribute to your packages are 
familiar with that setup.  If they have to fork 20 packages at once to 
make a contribution to one of them, they are less likely to want to do it.

Kevin,

R-Forge is still alive but there are problems with the build queue as you 
noticed. The problems occurred after R-Forge upgraded to R 4.4.0 - just as 
there was a switch in the maintenance team at WU Wien.

The problem is with the Windows build/check tools which work fine when run 
manually but either fail (if there is compiled code in the package) or stall 
when run in batch mode.

Jorge, the new member in the admin team at WU, has been going through all the 
scripts with Uwe (Ligges) but they haven't spotted the problem so far. I think 
that the next step will be to migrate the Windows build/check processes to the 
Win-Builder machine.

I hope that they will succeed in doing so in the next weeks. Apologies for the 
inconvenience.

Best wishes,
Achim

I cannot/will not to help you do this, but there are people out there who disagree with me who put considerable effort into doing this... the search term you would need in order to find them is "monorepo". But please reconsider...  the whole point of putting code into separate packages is to isolate their internals to make them less interdependent... putting all of them into a monorepo can lead you to forget that users experience them as distinct units.

Thanks a lot, Achim,
for the update and explanation!

I maintain quite a few packages on R-forge,
enjoying the simplicity of svn (subversion) on the way.

For automatic building and checking,  some of you may be aware
that the R-OpenSci organization has hosted and sponsored the
"R-Universe" project https://ropensci.org/r-universe/,
implemented and made quite successful I think primarily by
Jeroen Ooms.   A main goal (I think) has been to *be* as
universal as possible, and provide a "portal" for "all" publicly
hosted R packages and not only foster to private company-owned
platforms such as github, but rather work with more general
"organizations" such as CRAN and BioC (each via their 'Meta
CRAN'), then also R-forge and many many more, see
    https://r-universe.dev/organizations/

Consequently, the R-forge packages are also all mirrored and
presented there, *and* also built and checked,
   --> https://r-forge.r-universe.dev/
... sometimes (somewhat confusingly to us, in one case) checking
against non-released versions of CRAN packages (instead of the stable
CRAN version)  which of course may be useful ((and I think is
similar to how R-forge works;  if there are released and
unreleased version of packages around, it's not easily
determinable *which* version should be used for tests of other
packages)).

Anyway, I was glad in one case that R-universe provided a built
version of the development version of one of my packages other
users could easily install.

Martin

PS:  I have not been a fan of r-universe, notably originally, as
it diverts attention away from R-project and CRAN, but then did
notice how useful it can be to the R users community, and how
well it has been maintained, hence these kudos!

+1 Thanks for pointing to R-universe, Martin, indeed an excellent service!

An additional detail about the packages at:

https://R-Forge.R-universe.dev/

This are the development versions of the R-Forge packages that are already 
released on CRAN.

If anyone has R-Forge packages that are not (yet) released on CRAN and you 
want to deploy them via R-universe, then you can do so by setting up your 
own universe. I'm using that for many of my R-Forge packages, see

https://zeileis.R-universe.dev/

and

https://github.com/zeileis/zeileis.r-universe.dev

for the underlying configuration.

Best wishes,
Achim

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] NOTE about lack of prebuilt manual
Message-ID: <d8c9018d-6225-ebd3-9fc5-254c64b20f5c@dewey.myzen.co.uk>

Short version

I have recently tried to update two of my CRAN packages and I am getting 
the NOTE from R CMD check --as-cran

Package has help file(s) containing install/render-stage \Sexpr{} 
expressions but no prebuilt PDF manual.

(It comes on one line in the check.log)

What am I doing wrong?

===================

More details

Both packages have lived successfuly on CRAN for some time but my recent 
attempts to update lead to the NOTE shown above. I notice that the 
version currently on CRAN do have in the tarball a directory called 
build which amongst other thing does contain the package manual. However 
when I build the updated versions the tarball still contains a build 
directory but without the manual.

I am using 4.4.1 under Windows 10. I open a command line and do 
everything from there with R CMD, I do not use any helper package. The 
help files do not explicitly contain any instance of \Sexpr{} but they 
do contain macros. Both of them use mathjaxr and Rdpack and one also has 
some macros written by me. They have been like that for some while. The 
Rd files are hand-written, I do not use any package to generate 
documentation.

I notice that R CMD build has an option to turn off the manual but I do 
not set that and there does not seem to be a turn on option. I have 
looked at the NEWS for R4.4.0 and 4.4.1 but withou enlightenment. The 
versions on CRAN were probably generated with R 4.3.3 judgin by the date 
when I made them.

I know it is only a NOTE but I would like to know why it is happening.

I hope that is enough detail to be helpful but I can expand on any 
unclear areas.

This is something I'd run into recently as well.

The R devs changed the default from building the manual to not building the
manual. Now if you want (or need) to build the manual, you should add

BuildManual: TRUE

to your DESCRIPTION.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] cpp11 and "non-API calls to R"
Message-ID: <b73ddb20-bc88-48aa-97a1-266e9db4d4da@email.com>

Dear R-pkg-dev folk,

The cpp11 package, which was developed yet is no longer maintained by
Jim Hester, now triggers warnings on some CRAN pre-submit checks for
"non-API calls to R" via "SETLENGTH", "SET_TRUELENGTH", and others. The
relevant issue is https://github.com/r-lib/cpp11/issues/355, with a pull
request to resolve at https://github.com/r-lib/cpp11/pull/358. Problem
is the package is now largely inactive, with the PR hanging there for a
month or so unattended. I presume this warning means I can not resubmit
any package depending on cpp11 until this is resolved. But then there
are currently 75 packages potentially affected by this which would then
also be unable to be resubmitted. (Follow the links from the main GitHub
issue for a glimpse of the scale of this problem.)

Any suggestions? In particular, it would be helpful, in this arguably
unusual and quite prominent case, to hear any views from CRAN folk as to
whether everybody dependent on cpp11 will have to wait for resolution
before they'll be able to resubmit? Alternatively, any indication from
anybody in a position to opine on cpp11 status and future maintenance
plans would be great!

Thanks,

Mark

   Have you contacted the maintainer directly (i.e. by e-mail)?  (Yes, 
they should be paying attention to Github, but trying another channel 
never hurts.)

   My personal experience is that I was succeeded in submitting a 
package update to CRAN even though there were NOTEs of this sort (in 
that case SET_TYPEOF) arising from an upstream package 
<https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp/issues/1312>; I explained the issue in 
my cover letter.

   It may take a while to sort out all of the fallout from the 
tightening of the API rules; I think the CRAN maintainers are aware of this.

   cheers

Hi Mark,

As someone else affected by this issue, it is actually quite tough to
resolve. This is because quite literally every other day, the list of what
is and is not non-API is changing. It is particularly challenging since
this is in R-devel and not any stable R release.

If there were a stable list of non-API and a stable release of R that this
is associated with it is my guess that the PR would?ve been merged by now.

Well, not really, we still build manuals unless file(s) containing 
install/render-stage \Sexpr{}  are present (as in this case).

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Segfaults on R-devel
Message-ID: <CO6PR09MB8597FE4D0E145AA6B5C61DF789DA2@CO6PR09MB8597.namprd09.prod.outlook.com>

Seemingly starting with the most recent builds of R-devel, I?ve been getting segfaults related to a piece of cpp code that indexes a zero-size NumericVector.  Essentially the same as this dummy example:

```
library(Rcpp)

sourceCpp(
  code = '
  #include<Rcpp.h>
  using namespace Rcpp;

  // [[Rcpp::export]]
  NumericVector zeroindex() {
    NumericVector zerosize(0);

    Rcout << zerosize[0] << std::endl;

    return zerosize;
  }
  '
)

zeroindex()
```

On R-release and on previous builds, this returns something like:

```
6.92674e-310
numeric(0)
```

But on current R-devel containers:

```

 *** caught segfault ***

address 0x1, cause 'memory not mapped'



Traceback:

 1: .Call(<pointer: 0x7fa9369c7930>)

 2: zeroindex()



Possible actions:

1: abort (with core dump, if enabled)

2: normal R exit

3: exit R without saving workspace

4: exit R saving workspace
```

It was easy enough to write a catch for the zero-size vector, however I?m wondering why the discrepancy between R-devel and previous versions?

Best,
-DMC

   I'm pretty sure this is from this R-devel commit:

https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/commit/92c1d5de23c93576f55062e26d446feface07250

  This turns on stricter boundary checking, specifically see 
https://github.com/lme4/lme4/issues/794#issuecomment-2154948145

   Arguably, accessing an element of a zero-length vector is at least 
undefined behaviour, so you shouldn't be doing it ...

Hello everyone,

I hope this email finds you well.

I?m sorry to bother you, it?s the very first time I?m submitting a package to CRAN.

Recently my submission got rejected with the following feedback:
Non-FOSS package license (file LICENSE)

   Suggests or Enhances not in mainstream repositories:
     velocyto.R

   Found the following (possibly) invalid URLs:
     URL: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Seurat/index.html
       From: inst/doc/a_SuperCell.html
       Status: 200
       Message: OK
       CRAN URL not in canonical form

   The canonical URL of the CRAN page for a package is
     https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=pkgname<https://cran.r-project.org/package=pkgname>


   Size of tarball: 9076436 bytes


Flavor: r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-gcc, r-devel-windows-x86_64
Check: package dependencies, Result: NOTE
   Package suggested but not available for checking: ?velocyto.R'


The license we?re using is the standard CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 and is listed among the accepted licenses for CRAN.

I fixed the URL issue but how can I make CRAN accept the package ?

Thank you advance for your time and your help !

Have a nice day.

Matei Teleman
