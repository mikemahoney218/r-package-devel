Hi,

I have been maintaining packages in R-Forge for many tears. Last week I 
sent an email to r-forge at r-project.org to report problems with the build 
process. It appears that any changes I have pushed to R-Forge over 
approximately the last two months have resulted in the package remaining 
in the "Building" state, even though the logs suggest that the package 
built successfully on both LINUX and Windows. (Also, four of the six 
affected packages only included changes to the man pages to clean up 
NOTEs from the R cmd checks on old versions at CRAN, where the new 
versions now happily reside.) I have received no response nor 
acknowledgement to my email to R-Forge.

Assuming that R-Forge has finally succumbed to the ravages of entropy, 
does anyone have advice on creating a git project that contains multiple 
R packages? (I really don't want to have to create 20+ new git projects, 
one per package).

Best,
 ?? Kevin

Kevin,

I can't speak to whether R-Forge is dead, we migrated our projects to
github a long time ago.

The most straightforward answer for R packages in git repositories is
to use separate git projects.  we were even able to import the entire
SVN history and r-forge issue history to github for each of our r-forge
projects when we migrated. The only major complexity that I recall was
creating a table mapping svn contributors to github users (where
available).

If you want to do it all in one git repository, I strongly suggest that
you *still* import all the svn history, but that you do it in one
directory per project, since this is required by `R CMD build`.  We
sometimes use this 'one package per directory' approach in some of our
private repositories at work.  In this case, if you use an IDE like
RStudio, you'll still create separate *RStudio* projects in each
directory, so that you can build, install, test, etc each package from
the IDE, but you can use a single repository for all of it.

Your future self will thank you for having full version control history
of all the "Olde" (tm) versions.

Best of luck.  - Brian

   I don't know about R-forge, but it's perfectly workable to put 
multiple packages within a single repo, with each package in its own 
subdirectory.  You'll run into some headaches occasionally with (e.g.) 
CI machinery that assumes that the head of a git repo is also the 
primary package directory (e.g. 
https://github.com/r-hub/rhub/issues/584) ...

While you can put multiple packages in one Git repository, I'd suggest 
that you don't do that.  Most packages are in their own repository, and 
that means that users who want to contribute to your packages are 
familiar with that setup.  If they have to fork 20 packages at once to 
make a contribution to one of them, they are less likely to want to do it.

Kevin,

R-Forge is still alive but there are problems with the build queue as you 
noticed. The problems occurred after R-Forge upgraded to R 4.4.0 - just as 
there was a switch in the maintenance team at WU Wien.

The problem is with the Windows build/check tools which work fine when run 
manually but either fail (if there is compiled code in the package) or stall 
when run in batch mode.

Jorge, the new member in the admin team at WU, has been going through all the 
scripts with Uwe (Ligges) but they haven't spotted the problem so far. I think 
that the next step will be to migrate the Windows build/check processes to the 
Win-Builder machine.

I hope that they will succeed in doing so in the next weeks. Apologies for the 
inconvenience.

Best wishes,
Achim

I cannot/will not to help you do this, but there are people out there who disagree with me who put considerable effort into doing this... the search term you would need in order to find them is "monorepo". But please reconsider...  the whole point of putting code into separate packages is to isolate their internals to make them less interdependent... putting all of them into a monorepo can lead you to forget that users experience them as distinct units.

Thanks a lot, Achim,
for the update and explanation!

I maintain quite a few packages on R-forge,
enjoying the simplicity of svn (subversion) on the way.

For automatic building and checking,  some of you may be aware
that the R-OpenSci organization has hosted and sponsored the
"R-Universe" project https://ropensci.org/r-universe/,
implemented and made quite successful I think primarily by
Jeroen Ooms.   A main goal (I think) has been to *be* as
universal as possible, and provide a "portal" for "all" publicly
hosted R packages and not only foster to private company-owned
platforms such as github, but rather work with more general
"organizations" such as CRAN and BioC (each via their 'Meta
CRAN'), then also R-forge and many many more, see
    https://r-universe.dev/organizations/

Consequently, the R-forge packages are also all mirrored and
presented there, *and* also built and checked,
   --> https://r-forge.r-universe.dev/
... sometimes (somewhat confusingly to us, in one case) checking
against non-released versions of CRAN packages (instead of the stable
CRAN version)  which of course may be useful ((and I think is
similar to how R-forge works;  if there are released and
unreleased version of packages around, it's not easily
determinable *which* version should be used for tests of other
packages)).

Anyway, I was glad in one case that R-universe provided a built
version of the development version of one of my packages other
users could easily install.

Martin

PS:  I have not been a fan of r-universe, notably originally, as
it diverts attention away from R-project and CRAN, but then did
notice how useful it can be to the R users community, and how
well it has been maintained, hence these kudos!

+1 Thanks for pointing to R-universe, Martin, indeed an excellent service!

An additional detail about the packages at:

https://R-Forge.R-universe.dev/

This are the development versions of the R-Forge packages that are already 
released on CRAN.

If anyone has R-Forge packages that are not (yet) released on CRAN and you 
want to deploy them via R-universe, then you can do so by setting up your 
own universe. I'm using that for many of my R-Forge packages, see

https://zeileis.R-universe.dev/

and

https://github.com/zeileis/zeileis.r-universe.dev

for the underlying configuration.

Best wishes,
Achim
