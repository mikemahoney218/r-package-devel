Martin, Dirk, Kevin,
Thanks for your help.  To summarise: the order of access is undefined, and
every repo URL is accessed.   I'm working in an environment
where "known-good" is more important than "latest", so what follows is an
explanation of the problem space from my perspective.

What I am experimenting with is pinning down the versions of the packages
that a moderately complex solution is built against using a combination of
an internal repository of cached packages (internally written packages, our
own hopefully transient copies of packages archived from CRAN,
packages live on CRAN, and packages present in both Github and CRAN which
we build and cache locally) and a proxy that separately populates that
cache in specific build processes by intercepting requests to CRAN.  I'd
like to use the base R function if possible and I want to let the version
numbers in the dependencies float because a) we do need to maintain
approximate currency in what versions of packages we use and b) I have no
business monkeying around with third party's dependencies.  Renv looks
helpful but has some assumptions about disk access to its cache that I'd
rather avoid by running an internal repo.  The team is spread around the
world, so shared cache volumes are not a great idea.

The business with the multiple repo addresses is one approach to working
around Docker's inability to understand that people need to access the
Docker host's ports from inside a container or a build, and that the
current Docker treatment of the host's internal IP is far from transparent
(I have scripts that run both inside and outside of Docker containers and
they used to be able to work out for themselves what environment they run
in, thats got harder lately).  That led down a path in which one set of
addresses did not reject connection attempts, making each package
installation (and there are hundreds) take some number of minutes for the
connections to time out.  Thankfully I don't actually have to deal with
that.

We have had a few cases where our dependencies have been archived from CRAN
and we have maintained our own copy for a period of days to months, a
period in which we do not know what the next package version number is.  It
would be convenient to not have to think about that - a deterministic,
terminating search of a sequence of repos looked like a nice idea for that,
but I may have to do something different.

There was a recent case where a package made a breaking change in its
interface in a release (not version) update that broke another package we
depend on.  It would be nice to be able to temporarily pin that package at
its previous version (without updating the source of the third party
package that depends on it) to preserve our own build-ability while those
packages sort themselves out.

There is one case where a pull request for a CRAN-hosted package was
verbally accepted but never actioned so we have our own forked version of a
CRAN-hosted package which I need to decide what to do with one day soon.
Another case where the package version number is different in CRAN from the
one we want.

We have a dependency on a package that we build from a Git repo but which
is also present in CRAN.  I don't want to be dependent on the maintainers
keeping the package version in the Git copy of the DESCRIPTION file higher
than the version in CRAN.  Ideally I'd like to build and push to the
internal repo and not have to think about it after that. Same issue as
before arises, as it stands today I have to either worry about, and
probably edit, the version number in the build or manage the cache
population process so the internal package instance is added after any
CRAN-sourced dependencies and make sure that the public CRAN instances are
not accessed in the build.

All of these problems are soluble by special-casing the affected installs,
specifically managing the cache population (with a requirement that the
cache and CRAN not be searched at the same time), or editing version
numbers whose next values I do not control, but I would like to try for the
simplest approach first. I know I'm not going to get a clean solution here,
the relative weights of "known-good" and "latest" are different
depending on where you stand.

Untested:

install.packages() calls available.packages() to find out which packages 
are available - and passes a "filters" argument if supplied.
That can be a user defined filter. It should be possible to write a user 
defined filter which prefers the packages in your local repo.

Best,
Uwe Ligges

Intriguing.  Presumably that would work for update.packages() too?

(We actually have a use case at work, and as one way out I created another
side-repo to place a package with an incremented version number so it would
'win' on hightest version; this is due to some non-trivial issues with the
underlying dependencies.)

Interesting. That would also mean that putting a company repo first does 
not protect against dependency confusion attacks (people intentionally 
uploading packages with the same name as company internal packages on 
CRAN;

Jan,
Thats only the case if you want to allow later version numbers to override
the versions in the internal repository, the "known-good" is more important
than "latest" point above.

Having a defined set of dependencies while still maintaining currency is a
difficult problem.  Always fetching dependencies from a public source is a
very bad idea (which is why I am looking at these issues), but not doing it
accumulates future costs as interfaces and sets of bugs evolve and need to
be remediated.  Those future costs can become very large indeed in a large
system.

Compounding the problem, CRAN caching is not supported universally by
commercial infrastructure.  I think Artifactory and Nexus do it, the AWS
and Azure offerings don't.

Yes. I think so.

If your company is going to ensure that a package called pkgCompany is 
only looked for in a local repo by installl.packages() and friends,
I think in your cpmpany wide R installation you can set the option 
"available_packages_filters" to a self written one that is exclusively 
reporting results from the local repo for 'pkgCompany'.

Of course, this is not safe and can be overwritten by e user etc., but 
it needs quite some effort to trick people this way in using a malicious 
package from another repo. It would be simpler for attackers to persuade 
people to install the malicious software directly, I believe.

Best,
Uwe Ligges

Uwe,
Whether it takes a lot of effort to get malicious code into a company
depends on the pay-off, which can be large relative to the effort.  The
example of the hack before was largely interesting because the priorities
of the package users were fundamentally insecure (higher version number
wins, defaulting to public repositories) and the specific package names
meant that the hack was narrowly targeted, making it less likely to be
discovered than exfiltration code inserted into a widely used package.
Having an identifiable set of package dependencies at any point in time is
a beginning.  Its difficult to effectively control developer behaviour, so
there is a risk there, but what makes it into production can in principle
be identified and controlled.

I had a look at the CVE database, its difficult to identify R package
vulnerabilities there.  Some other searching turned up a couple of
vulnerabilities and some rather promotional blog posts, one of which
asserted that R code is almost always run in controlled environments, which
was sadly hilarious.

Is there a source of vulnerability information for R packages?  Are there
or have there been examples of actually malicious R packages in the wild?

   FWIW there is a repo for R advisories.

https://github.com/RConsortium/r-advisory-database

  with a front-end here

https://osv.dev/list?ecosystem=CRAN&q=

   At present all of the *reported* vulnerabilities seem to be caused by 
problems with underlying/bundled libraries ...

Hello,


I was wondering if its possible to link the toturial site for a package on the CRAN Cite to the package?

I want to publish the next version of our package.

The CRAN site (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RepeatedHighDim/index.html) has a "documentation" part with the refrence pdf.

Can I link to our tutorial site (https://software.klausjung-lab.de/.) under documentation?

Since your tutorial is relatively short and contains R code intermixed
with the results of running it, it could make a great vignette.
Vignettes are linked on the CRAN page for a package right under the
PDF reference manual. For example, the BiocManager package has one
vignette: https://cran.r-project.org/package=BiocManager

Vignettes are a part of the package and their code is automatically
checked together with your examples. For the users of your package,
this will help keep the tutorial available (even if the website moves
in the future) and compatible with the current version of the package
(even if the package evolves and the tutorial website evolves together
with it).

R has built-in support for PDF vignettes via LaTeX using Sweave [*].
HTML vignettes can be much more accessible than PDF files, but there is
no built-in HTML vignette engine in R [**]. The 'markdown' package is
reasonably lightweight and has an HTML vignette engine. Markdown tries
to be a superset of HTML, so it should be possible to keep most of your
original HTML, including the styling, while rewriting the tutorial as
an executable vignette.

-- 
Best regards,
Ivan

[*]
https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Writing-package-vignettes

[**]
It's possible to write a crude HTML vignette engine in ~100 lines of R
code, but we cannot expect every package author to do that.

Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.2.21.2404062047010.31629@anzu.alexisdinno.com>


Hello,

I would appreciate help with two build NOTEs:


First, On the Winbuilder check, the check for R version 4.4.0 alpha 
(2024-04-05 r86346 ucrt) and also under the Debian R Under development 
(unstable) (2024-04-05 r86348) I got a NOTE about a bunch of 'Lost 
braces' in my .Rd files. I am confused because my braces appear to match 
when I count them, and I don't *think* I am runing into an item/itemize 
situation. Here's an example (all the reported issues in this NOTE are 
within \references sections ):

  checkRd: (-1) LoopAnalyst-package.Rd:14: Lost braces
    14 |  Dambacher, J. M. and Li, H. W. and Rossignol, P. A. (2002) 
  \doi{10.2307/3071950}{Relevance of community structure in assessing 
  indeterminacy of ecological predictions}. \emph{Ecology}, 
  \bold{83(5)},1372--1385.

Here's the Winbuilder log:
https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/LoopAnalyst_1.2-7_20240406_215835/Windows/00check.log

And here's the Debian log:
https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/LoopAnalyst_1.2-7_20240406_215835/Debian/00check.log


The second NOTE is about "(possibly) invalid URLs:"
  URL: https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/367590
    Status: 403
    Message: Forbidden

However, when I follow this URL in my browser it appears to link 
appropriately to the intended page. If I use a \doi{10.1086/367590} 
instead of an \href I get the same behavior: check says "(possibly) 
invalid URLs" but https://doi.org/10.1086/367590 appears to work just 
fine in the browser. Not sure what I am doing wrong here.

The braces are lost in the sense that they are superfluous (not typeset in the pdf manual but may be typeset in other formats. In your example \doi has one argument, so the braces enclosing the following phrase are superfluous.

This may not be harmful here but since CRAN introduced the NOTE it has uncovered thousands of actual typos and similar.

As to the 'invalid url', you can ignore it when you are sure that it is correct - some sites don't like being accessed programatically and start blocking the caller (eg if you run R checks several times in succession).

It appears you are trying to pass two arguments to \doi, but it only 
takes one.  I would have thought that would be fine, but apparently not.

So add a space after "\doi{10.2307/3071950}" and/or remove the braces 
around "{Relevance of community structure in assessing indeterminacy of 
ecological predictions}".
