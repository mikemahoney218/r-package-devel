Martin, Dirk, Kevin,
Thanks for your help.  To summarise: the order of access is undefined, and
every repo URL is accessed.   I'm working in an environment
where "known-good" is more important than "latest", so what follows is an
explanation of the problem space from my perspective.

What I am experimenting with is pinning down the versions of the packages
that a moderately complex solution is built against using a combination of
an internal repository of cached packages (internally written packages, our
own hopefully transient copies of packages archived from CRAN,
packages live on CRAN, and packages present in both Github and CRAN which
we build and cache locally) and a proxy that separately populates that
cache in specific build processes by intercepting requests to CRAN.  I'd
like to use the base R function if possible and I want to let the version
numbers in the dependencies float because a) we do need to maintain
approximate currency in what versions of packages we use and b) I have no
business monkeying around with third party's dependencies.  Renv looks
helpful but has some assumptions about disk access to its cache that I'd
rather avoid by running an internal repo.  The team is spread around the
world, so shared cache volumes are not a great idea.

The business with the multiple repo addresses is one approach to working
around Docker's inability to understand that people need to access the
Docker host's ports from inside a container or a build, and that the
current Docker treatment of the host's internal IP is far from transparent
(I have scripts that run both inside and outside of Docker containers and
they used to be able to work out for themselves what environment they run
in, thats got harder lately).  That led down a path in which one set of
addresses did not reject connection attempts, making each package
installation (and there are hundreds) take some number of minutes for the
connections to time out.  Thankfully I don't actually have to deal with
that.

We have had a few cases where our dependencies have been archived from CRAN
and we have maintained our own copy for a period of days to months, a
period in which we do not know what the next package version number is.  It
would be convenient to not have to think about that - a deterministic,
terminating search of a sequence of repos looked like a nice idea for that,
but I may have to do something different.

There was a recent case where a package made a breaking change in its
interface in a release (not version) update that broke another package we
depend on.  It would be nice to be able to temporarily pin that package at
its previous version (without updating the source of the third party
package that depends on it) to preserve our own build-ability while those
packages sort themselves out.

There is one case where a pull request for a CRAN-hosted package was
verbally accepted but never actioned so we have our own forked version of a
CRAN-hosted package which I need to decide what to do with one day soon.
Another case where the package version number is different in CRAN from the
one we want.

We have a dependency on a package that we build from a Git repo but which
is also present in CRAN.  I don't want to be dependent on the maintainers
keeping the package version in the Git copy of the DESCRIPTION file higher
than the version in CRAN.  Ideally I'd like to build and push to the
internal repo and not have to think about it after that. Same issue as
before arises, as it stands today I have to either worry about, and
probably edit, the version number in the build or manage the cache
population process so the internal package instance is added after any
CRAN-sourced dependencies and make sure that the public CRAN instances are
not accessed in the build.

All of these problems are soluble by special-casing the affected installs,
specifically managing the cache population (with a requirement that the
cache and CRAN not be searched at the same time), or editing version
numbers whose next values I do not control, but I would like to try for the
simplest approach first. I know I'm not going to get a clean solution here,
the relative weights of "known-good" and "latest" are different
depending on where you stand.

Untested:

install.packages() calls available.packages() to find out which packages 
are available - and passes a "filters" argument if supplied.
That can be a user defined filter. It should be possible to write a user 
defined filter which prefers the packages in your local repo.

Best,
Uwe Ligges

Intriguing.  Presumably that would work for update.packages() too?

(We actually have a use case at work, and as one way out I created another
side-repo to place a package with an incremented version number so it would
'win' on hightest version; this is due to some non-trivial issues with the
underlying dependencies.)

Interesting. That would also mean that putting a company repo first does 
not protect against dependency confusion attacks (people intentionally 
uploading packages with the same name as company internal packages on 
CRAN;

Jan,
Thats only the case if you want to allow later version numbers to override
the versions in the internal repository, the "known-good" is more important
than "latest" point above.

Having a defined set of dependencies while still maintaining currency is a
difficult problem.  Always fetching dependencies from a public source is a
very bad idea (which is why I am looking at these issues), but not doing it
accumulates future costs as interfaces and sets of bugs evolve and need to
be remediated.  Those future costs can become very large indeed in a large
system.

Compounding the problem, CRAN caching is not supported universally by
commercial infrastructure.  I think Artifactory and Nexus do it, the AWS
and Azure offerings don't.

Yes. I think so.

If your company is going to ensure that a package called pkgCompany is 
only looked for in a local repo by installl.packages() and friends,
I think in your cpmpany wide R installation you can set the option 
"available_packages_filters" to a self written one that is exclusively 
reporting results from the local repo for 'pkgCompany'.

Of course, this is not safe and can be overwritten by e user etc., but 
it needs quite some effort to trick people this way in using a malicious 
package from another repo. It would be simpler for attackers to persuade 
people to install the malicious software directly, I believe.

Best,
Uwe Ligges

Uwe,
Whether it takes a lot of effort to get malicious code into a company
depends on the pay-off, which can be large relative to the effort.  The
example of the hack before was largely interesting because the priorities
of the package users were fundamentally insecure (higher version number
wins, defaulting to public repositories) and the specific package names
meant that the hack was narrowly targeted, making it less likely to be
discovered than exfiltration code inserted into a widely used package.
Having an identifiable set of package dependencies at any point in time is
a beginning.  Its difficult to effectively control developer behaviour, so
there is a risk there, but what makes it into production can in principle
be identified and controlled.

I had a look at the CVE database, its difficult to identify R package
vulnerabilities there.  Some other searching turned up a couple of
vulnerabilities and some rather promotional blog posts, one of which
asserted that R code is almost always run in controlled environments, which
was sadly hilarious.

Is there a source of vulnerability information for R packages?  Are there
or have there been examples of actually malicious R packages in the wild?

   FWIW there is a repo for R advisories.

https://github.com/RConsortium/r-advisory-database

  with a front-end here

https://osv.dev/list?ecosystem=CRAN&q=

   At present all of the *reported* vulnerabilities seem to be caused by 
problems with underlying/bundled libraries ...

Hello,


I was wondering if its possible to link the toturial site for a package on the CRAN Cite to the package?

I want to publish the next version of our package.

The CRAN site (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RepeatedHighDim/index.html) has a "documentation" part with the refrence pdf.

Can I link to our tutorial site (https://software.klausjung-lab.de/.) under documentation?

Since your tutorial is relatively short and contains R code intermixed
with the results of running it, it could make a great vignette.
Vignettes are linked on the CRAN page for a package right under the
PDF reference manual. For example, the BiocManager package has one
vignette: https://cran.r-project.org/package=BiocManager

Vignettes are a part of the package and their code is automatically
checked together with your examples. For the users of your package,
this will help keep the tutorial available (even if the website moves
in the future) and compatible with the current version of the package
(even if the package evolves and the tutorial website evolves together
with it).

R has built-in support for PDF vignettes via LaTeX using Sweave [*].
HTML vignettes can be much more accessible than PDF files, but there is
no built-in HTML vignette engine in R [**]. The 'markdown' package is
reasonably lightweight and has an HTML vignette engine. Markdown tries
to be a superset of HTML, so it should be possible to keep most of your
original HTML, including the styling, while rewriting the tutorial as
an executable vignette.

-- 
Best regards,
Ivan

[*]
https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Writing-package-vignettes

[**]
It's possible to write a crude HTML vignette engine in ~100 lines of R
code, but we cannot expect every package author to do that.

Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.2.21.2404062047010.31629@anzu.alexisdinno.com>


Hello,

I would appreciate help with two build NOTEs:


First, On the Winbuilder check, the check for R version 4.4.0 alpha 
(2024-04-05 r86346 ucrt) and also under the Debian R Under development 
(unstable) (2024-04-05 r86348) I got a NOTE about a bunch of 'Lost 
braces' in my .Rd files. I am confused because my braces appear to match 
when I count them, and I don't *think* I am runing into an item/itemize 
situation. Here's an example (all the reported issues in this NOTE are 
within \references sections ):

  checkRd: (-1) LoopAnalyst-package.Rd:14: Lost braces
    14 |  Dambacher, J. M. and Li, H. W. and Rossignol, P. A. (2002) 
  \doi{10.2307/3071950}{Relevance of community structure in assessing 
  indeterminacy of ecological predictions}. \emph{Ecology}, 
  \bold{83(5)},1372--1385.

Here's the Winbuilder log:
https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/LoopAnalyst_1.2-7_20240406_215835/Windows/00check.log

And here's the Debian log:
https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/LoopAnalyst_1.2-7_20240406_215835/Debian/00check.log


The second NOTE is about "(possibly) invalid URLs:"
  URL: https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/367590
    Status: 403
    Message: Forbidden

However, when I follow this URL in my browser it appears to link 
appropriately to the intended page. If I use a \doi{10.1086/367590} 
instead of an \href I get the same behavior: check says "(possibly) 
invalid URLs" but https://doi.org/10.1086/367590 appears to work just 
fine in the browser. Not sure what I am doing wrong here.

The braces are lost in the sense that they are superfluous (not typeset in the pdf manual but may be typeset in other formats. In your example \doi has one argument, so the braces enclosing the following phrase are superfluous.

This may not be harmful here but since CRAN introduced the NOTE it has uncovered thousands of actual typos and similar.

As to the 'invalid url', you can ignore it when you are sure that it is correct - some sites don't like being accessed programatically and start blocking the caller (eg if you run R checks several times in succession).

It appears you are trying to pass two arguments to \doi, but it only 
takes one.  I would have thought that would be fine, but apparently not.

So add a space after "\doi{10.2307/3071950}" and/or remove the braces 
around "{Relevance of community structure in assessing indeterminacy of 
ecological predictions}".

Hi Mikael

Revisiting this. Have the plans changed for 1.7-0 release?

Yes.  Matrix 1.7-0 *has* been on CRAN now for while
(i.e. 'March' has remained as announced), *but*
-- because of the ABI change and the problem it can cause for
   *some* users --

we have made it  'Depends: R (>= 4.4.0)'
i.e., you *see* the new Matrix only once you use R 4.4.0
which has been available as "alpha" already and is now in
"beta" already, e.g.,

  R version 4.4.0 beta (2024-04-10 r86393) -- "Puppy Cup"

Thank you Martin.

Indeed, I should have dug further.

Hello,

I'm tryign to resolve a note that is preventing my cran submission. This is from the detail log:


Flavor: r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-gcc, r-devel-windows-x86_64
Check: CRAN incoming feasibility, Result: NOTE
  Maintainer: 'Chris Knoll <cknoll at ohdsi.org>'

  New submission

  Package has a VignetteBuilder field but no prebuilt vignette index.

  Package has FOSS license, installs .class/.jar but has no 'java' directory.

  Found the following (possibly) invalid URLs:
    URL: http://ohdsi.github.io/CirceR/ (moved to https://ohdsi.github.io/CirceR/)
      From: README.md
      Status: 301

      Status: 301
      Message: Moved Permanently
    For content that is 'Moved Permanently', please change http to https,
    add trailing slashes, or replace the old by the new URL.


The URL changes are easy enough, but I'm curious about the first 2 notes:

For "Package has VignetteBuilder field but no prebuilt vignette index", how would this be resolved?

For "Package ahs FOSS license, installs .class/.jar but has no 'java directory'':  This is custom code that I've written in Java plus has a few maven dependencies and I'm not sure if they are asking me to bundle the source code of all Java dependencies (that have classes in the jar file).   That could be hard to do, and was hoping if anyone had experience in this, is it enough to put into the Readme where such source code could be found?

Thank you for your guidance.

-Chris

The package at https://github.com/OHDSI/CirceR/ doesn't seem to have any
vignettes. Without vignettes, there's no need for VignetteBuilder:
knitr.

Here's what the policy has to say:

>> For Java .class and .jar files, the sources should be in a top-level
>> java directory in the source package (or that directory should
>> explain how they can be obtained).

<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html>

At the very least, XLconnect seems to be fine supplying just the
README. If it's not too much trouble, shipping your custom source code
(definitely not all of the maven dependencies) would be the kind thing
to do, I think. (Feel free to disregard this part if a more experienced
Java package developer says otherwise.)

Hello everyone,
I need to write references in the description of my package Description file in the form authors (year) <doi:>.
The problem is that it is a paper from the 70's (Priestley and Taylor, 1972) and its DOI has very uncommon symbols, such as <>. The DOI is:
10.1175/1520-0493(1972)100<0081:OTAOSH>2.3.CO;2.
Therefore, when I write it in the description, I mean
Priestley and Taylor (1972) <doi:10.1175/1520-0493(1972)100<0081:OTAOSH>2.3.CO;2>  the devtools::check_win_devel() returns the following message:
"Found the following (possibly) invalid DOIs:
  DOI: 10.1175/1520-0493(1972)100<0081:OTAOSH
    From: DESCRIPTION
          man/CropWaterBalance-package.Rd
    Status: 404
    Message: Not Found"
Even though the doi is available, should I replace the doi by the authors (year) <[https:...]https:...> ?
If yes, would the reference become?
Priestley and Taylor (1972) <[https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/mwre/100/2/1520-0493_1972_100_0081_otaosh_2_3_co_2.xml]https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/mwre/100/2/1520-0493_1972_100_0081_otaosh_2_3_co_2.xml> ?

Since the R CMD check function responsible for locating and checking
the DOIs from the package metadata expects to see them URL-encoded, it
should be possible to put your DOI through paste0('<doi:',
utils::URLencode(doi), '>') in order to generate the correct link.

Another workaround is to generate a shortDOI that would redirect to the
same place as the original DOI:
https://shortdoi.org/10.1175/1520-0493(1972)100%3C0081:OTAOSH%3E2.3.CO;2
Now <doi:10/cr3qwn> should work like the original DOI.

Hello,
When I apply the devtools::check_win_devel() to my package it shows the following message:
----------------
Possibly misspelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  Samani (40:21)
  al (38:45)
  et (38:42)
-----------------
I already inserted these words in the WORDLIST.
Should I use 'Samani' and 'et al.' to prevent this message in the text below?

Description: Calculates daily climate water balance for irrigation purposes.  The package also calculates the reference 'evapotranspiration' using three methods, ('Penman and Monteith') Allen et al. (1998,ISBN:92-5-104219-5),
 Priestley and Taylor (1972) <doi:10/cr3qwn>,
  or Hargreaves and Samani (1985) <doi:10.13031/2013.26773>.
  Users may specify a management allowed depletion ('MAD'), which is
  used by the package to suggest when irrigate. It also allows the use of crop and water stress coefficients.

Thanks in advance.

   Based on the information in this thread,

https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-package-devel/2024q1/010558.html

   I don't think there is any way to suppress these notes. (I have been 
meaning to submit a documentation for _Writing R Extensions_ that talks 
about spell-checking options, which AFAICT isn't actually mentioned 
anywhere in the docs ...)

   What do you mean by "already inserted these words in the WORDLIST"?

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] error in windows R-devel builder,
 but not anywhere else
Message-ID: <AS4P195MB143048FFE27E4C642158B035BE0B2@AS4P195MB1430.EURP195.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Hi everyone,

I am updating my R package (tinycodet), and I have checked my R-package in all operating systems (Linux, Mac, Windows). All examples and tests run correctly for Linux, Mac, and Windows.  Rcmd checks also finds no issues on GitHub (I use rather strict Rcmdcheck workflows on GitHub, so any issues should be found quickly on GitHub; see https://github.com/tony-aw/tinycodet). But on the Win R-devel builder, I get an error. I use a Windows computer myself, and I can see where the error takes place on the win R-devel-builder, but I cannot reproduce the error. The error should not even be there.

The error takes place in the function `strfind(x, p, ..., i, rt)<-`. When the user specifies an incorrect string for the optional argument `rt`, the error message "improper `rt?`given" is called. This is also the error message that occurs in Win R-devel Builder, but it shouldn't be there, since no incorrect string is specified for "rt" there - otherwise, all operating systems would give an error there.
Link to win R-devel builder results: https://win-builder.r-project.org/2mG2vk48tri3/

My package has no Operating System specific functionality.

The fact that this error ONLY happens on win R-devel builder, and not when I run it on my windows laptop, nor on any other OS, nor on the many checks on GitHub, implies the issue might be on the Windows R-devel builder. But I don't want to jump to conclusions. Hence my question is:
Is there currently an issue in win R-devel-builder? If not, why is the error only on win R-devel-builder, and not anywhere else?

Thanks in advance for your help.

Kind regards,

Tony

Looks like this recent change to R-devel has caught you:

       \code{is.atomic(NULL)} now returns \code{FALSE}, as \code{NULL}
       is not an atomic vector.  Strict back-compatibility would
       replace \code{is.atomic(foo)} by \code{(is.null(foo) || 
is.atomic(foo))}
       but should happen only sparingly.

I don't know why you didn't see this on the other platforms; maybe they 
just haven't been rebuilt recently.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] puzzling removal of 'dotwhisker' from CRAN
Message-ID: <8d9ab8de-476e-4e9e-92ab-9120f21b06f1@gmail.com>

   The 'dotwhisker' package was archived on CRAN: from 
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dotwhisker/index.html

     Package ?dotwhisker? was removed from the CRAN repository
     ...

     Archived on 2024-04-12 as requires archived package 'prediction'.

    However, I can't for the life of me see where this dependence could 
come from. Neither the DESCRIPTION file of the last-archived version on 
CRAN 
<https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/dotwhisker/dotwhisker_0.8.1.tar.gz>, 
nor the version on github <https://github.com/fsolt/dotwhisker>, seem to 
show any signs of importing prediction ... ?? I suppose there's a 
possibility of a recursive dependence, but in that case why wouldn't the 
direct dependence be reported?

Depends: R (>= 3.2.0), ggplot2 (>= 2.2.1),
Imports: grid, gtable, gridExtra, stats, parameters, performance,
         patchwork, margins, dplyr, stringr, ggstance, rlang, purrr
Suggests: ordinal, tibble, knitr, rmarkdown, broom

   What am I missing?

   (I'm concerned because I have packages that Suggest: dotwhisker, and 
the absence of the package from repos is breaking GitHub Actions checks ...)

Well, after trying to install the package, I believe the issue is because
margins has been archived.

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/margins/index.html

You can check recursive dependencies using
`tools::package_dependencies("pkg", recursive = TRUE)` which would help you
in this case. I couldn't run it since the package is not available on CRAN,
however.

    Yes, but ffbase was archived a long time ago (2022-04-04) and CRAN 
has apparently just caught up to checking.  What's a little frustrating 
(to me) is that the dependence of prediction on ffbase is *very* soft 
("enhances") ...

No, but CRAN  has still not received an update and asked for this each 
month this year, so in Jan, Feb, and March without a response, so we 
assume prediction is unmaintained. Also, this was escalated to reverse 
depends.

Best,

  To clarify, from an off-list conversation:

   AFAICT the chain is

   dotwhisker Imports
      margins, which Imports
        prediction, which Enhances
          ffbase  (archived in 2022 for 'coercion to logical' problems)

  (that conversation also pointed out that Enhances is a dependency *in 
the opposite direction* -- i.e. if A Enhances B, it's not entirely clear 
why the disappearance of B should matter at all ...)

Uwe, has the CRAN Team ever considered making these request-for-update
email messages from CRAN public in real-time? For instance, there
could be a public "read-only" mailing list that anyone can subscribe
to, but not send/reply to. I see several advantages with such an
approach, e.g.

* maintainers of reverse dependencies would be aware of potential
problems much sooner,
* so would end-users who rely on the package (who often only notice
when a package is archived),
* the community could early on offer their help to the package maintainer, and
* the community could help locate and notify maintainers whose email
addresses are no longer working.

I'd imagine this would help lower the workload on the CRAN Team, so a
win-win for everyone. I, for sure, would find that useful.

Thanks,

Henrik

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Package submission to CRAN not passing incoming checks
Message-ID: <DM8PR04MB7960BD13680B61AC4567E1FEC6122@DM8PR04MB7960.namprd04.prod.outlook.com>

Dear R-package-devel,

This my first post--I read the posting guidelines, but my apologies in advance if I make a mistake.

I am trying to post my R package to CRAN. I just submitted it to CRAN but received a note that the package "does not pass the incoming checks automatically".

Here are the results from win-builder: https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/petersenlab_0.1.2-9033_20240415_212322/

As far as I can tell, there are 3 notes to address. However, I'm not sure how to address them.

1) The first note appears to be "Version contains large components", which includes the contents of the LICENSE file (CC BY 4.0). I'm not sure if this is a problem that needs to be addressed (or how to address it).

2) The second note says:

"Found the following (possibly) invalid file URIs:
  URI: 10.1177/0146621613475471
    From: man/itemInformation.Rd
  URI: 10.1177/0146621613475471
    From: man/standardErrorIRT.Rd"

However, I verified that those DOIs resolve correctly, so I'm not sure how to address this note.

3) The third note (in the Debian but not Windows version) says:

"* checking for non-standard things in the check directory ... NOTE
Found the following files/directories:
  ?encryptionKey.RData? ?encrypytedCredentials.txt?"

These files are generated in the examples for one of the functions to demonstrate how to read data using an encryption key: https://github.com/DevPsyLab/petersenlab/blob/9ece9d7dc32727c1315a03bc2810cc9c957971d1/R/readEncryptedData.R#L24. I'm not sure if this is a problem that needs to be addressed (or how to address it).

The source code for my R package (petersenlab) is here: https://github.com/DevPsyLab/petersenlab

Thanks very much in advance,
Isaac

1. The version number complaint is the use of 0.1.2-9033. It is complaining
about 9033. Personally, I would not use the -XXXX style, but that is a
personal choice I guess. R-exts says
  "The mandatory ?Version? field gives the version of the package. This is
a sequence of at least *two* (and usually three) non-negative integers
separated by single ?.? or ?-? characters. The canonical form is as shown
in the example, and a version such as ?0.01? or ?0.01.0? will be handled as
if it were ?0.1-0?. It is *not* a decimal number, so for example 0.9 < 0.75
since 9 < 75."
2. Those are not URLs, they are DOIs. The Rd format has a \doi{} command
you should use
3. If your examples generate files, I would use the tempfile() command from
base R.

Dear Isaac,

Welcome to R-package-devel! You're doing just fine.

> 1) The first note <...> includes the contents of the LICENSE file

It's multiple NOTEs in a trench coat. Kasper has addressed the "large
version components" and the DOIs interpreted as file URIs, but there's
one more.

The '<standard license code> + file LICENSE' syntax has two uses: (1)
for when the terms of the license is a template, requiring the author
of the software to substitute some information (e.g. the year and the
copyright holder for MIT) and (2) for when a package puts additional
restrictions on the base license.

(Hmm. Only case (2) is currently described at
<https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Licensing>; case
(1) is only described inside the license files.)

The CRAN team has expressed a preference for the package authors not to
put 20000 twisty little copies of standard licenses, all slightly

There is one more NOTE:

The examples are not only for the user to read in the help page; they
are also for the user to run example(vwReg) and see your code in action
(and for R CMD check to see whether they crash, including regularly on
CRAN).

For vwReg, try reducing the number of regressions you are running
(since your dataset is mtcars, which is already very compact).

For load_or_install, we have the additional issue that running
example(load_or_install) modifies the contents of the R library and the
search path, which belong to the user. The CRAN policy forbids such
modifications: <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html>

Examples in general should change as little of the global state of the
R session and the underlying computer as possible. I suggest wrapping
the example in \dontrun{} (since everything about load_or_install() is
about altering global state) and creating a test for the function in
tests/*.R.

The test should set up a new library under tempdir(), run
load_or_install(), check the outcomes (that the desired package is
attached, etc.) and clean up after itself. There's also the matter of
the package not failing without a connection to the Internet, which is
another CRAN policy requirement. You might have to bring a very small
test package in inst/extdata just for load_or_install() to install and
load it, so that R CMD check won't fail when running offline.

Dear Ivan and Kasper,



Thanks very much for the helpful guidance. I made the changes you described, including changing the version number (to 1.0.0), changing the URL codes to DOI codes, using the tempfile() command when generating files, changing the license to MIT (and excluding the license file in the .Rbuildignore file), and enclosing some examples with \dontrun{}.



Following Ivan?s suggestion, I created a test file to verify that the load_or_install() function works as expected, and included two small test packages to verify that the function can install and load them without needing access to the internet. However, I receive an error when running the test locally (the error is enclosed below this email). The error suggests to me that the test cannot load the packages with library() after installing them.



My test file is here:

https://github.com/DevPsyLab/petersenlab/blob/main/tests/testthat/test_load_or_install.R



I included the packages (including the raw package folders and their .tar.gz files) in the /inst/extdata folder.



Any help would be greatly appreciated.



Many thanks,

Isaac

Welcome to R-package-devel! You're doing just fine.

> 1) The first note <...> includes the contents of the LICENSE file

It's multiple NOTEs in a trench coat. Kasper has addressed the "large
version components" and the DOIs interpreted as file URIs, but there's
one more.

The '<standard license code> + file LICENSE' syntax has two uses: (1)
for when the terms of the license is a template, requiring the author
of the software to substitute some information (e.g. the year and the
copyright holder for MIT) and (2) for when a package puts additional
restrictions on the base license.

(Hmm. Only case (2) is currently described at
<https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcran.r-project.org%2Fdoc%2Fmanuals%2FR-exts.html%23Licensing&data=05%7C02%7Cisaac-t-petersen%40uiowa.edu%7C3a0f2254132f4cd6205608dc63610e82%7C1bc445959aba4fc3b8ec7b94a5586fdc%7C1%7C1%7C638494515735410190%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C40000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=rm%2Fp2SXR6CN%2FysfsiP1i2acQcrYlxPfUgxMF6NQdvlA%3D&reserved=0<https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Licensing>>; case
(1) is only described inside the license files.)

The CRAN team has expressed a preference for the package authors not to
put 20000 twisty little copies of standard licenses, all slightly
different, inside their packages. Since you're not restricting CC BY
4.0, it's enough to say 'License: CC BY 4.0'. If you'd like a full copy
of the license text in your source code repository, that's fine, but
you'll need to list the file in .Rbuildignore:

Would you prefer your test to install them from the source directories
(as you currently do, in which case the *.tar.gz files can be omitted)
or the *.tar.gz files (in which case you can set the `repos` argument
to a file:/// URI and omit the package directories and the setwd()
calls)?

I think (but haven't tested) that the two problems that are currently
breaking your test are with .libPaths() and setwd().

.libPaths(temp_lib) overwrites the library paths with `temp_lib` and
the system libraries, the ones in %PROGRAMFILES%\R\R-*\library. In
particular, this removes %LOCALAPPDATA%\R\win-library\* from the list
of library paths, so the packages installed by the user (including
'waldo', which is needed by 'testthat') stop being available.

In order to add temp_lib to the list of the paths, use
.libPaths(c(temp_lib, .libPaths())).

Since setwd() returns the previous directory, one that was current
before setwd() was called, the code newpath <- setwd(filepath);
setwd(newpath) will keep the current directory, not set it to
`filepath`. Use oldpath <- setwd(filepath) instead.

Since you're already using 'testthat' and it already depends on
'withr', you may find it easier to use withr::local_dir(...) and
withr::local_temp_libpaths(...).

In order to test for a package being attached by load_or_install() (and
not just installed and loadable), check for 'package:testpackage1'
being present in the return value of search(). (This check is good
enough and much easier to write than comparing environments on the
search path with the package exports or comparing searchpaths() with
the paths under the temporary library.)

Finally, I think that there is no need for the test_load_or_install()
call because I don't see the function being defined anywhere. Doesn't
test_that(...) run the tests by itself?

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Some, but not all vignettes compressed
Message-ID: <C616093F-CCCC-40A6-99E1-C91754261ACF@depauw.edu>

I have a peculiar problem regarding vignette compaction. Package LearnPCA has 8 vignettes.  I am working on the devel branch with code at https://github.com/bryanhanson/LearnPCA/tree/devel.

The problem is that at CRAN and on win-builder they detect that 5/8 vignettes need to be compacted.  Locally however, 2/8 vignettes, not overlapping with the 5/8 identified at CRAN, are compacted during build.  When I try to compact manually, compactPDF() reports it is not necesssary.

I have looked at a related question by Ben Bolker (https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-package-devel/2020q4/006086.html) but that doesn't seem resolved.  I am already taking the steps listed in this question: https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-package-devel/2023q4/009831.html as well as several others.

Regarding versions, I get

gs --version
10.03.0

qpdf --version
qpdf version 11.9.0

Which seem to be the latest.  Note these were installed with HomeBrew but I think R ships with at its own version of qpdf:

Sys.which(Sys.getenv("R_QPDF", "qpdf"))
  /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/qpdf 
"/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/qpdf" 

I did not try the HomeBrew versions until I ran into trouble.

Here are the steps I am taking.  I am on MacOS 14.4.1, an M1 chip.

1. Build via a makefile, with this command:

R --no-init-file CMD build --resave-data --compact-vignettes=both $(PKG_NAME)

The build process reports:

* creating vignettes ... OK
* compacting vignettes and other PDF files
    compacted ?Vig_01_Start_Here.pdf? from 244Kb to 44Kb
    compacted ?Vig_08_Notes.pdf? from 239Kb to 38Kb     

Fine so far.

I also tried to force the path to gs:

export R_GSCMD="/opt/homebrew/bin/gs"; \
export GS_QUALITY="ebook"; \
R --no-init-file CMD build --resave-data --compact-vignettes=both $(PKG_NAME)

With the same result.  I did this because it seems R doesn't see my installation of GhostScript.

And I tried to force a path to both compacting services:

export R_GSCMD="/opt/homebrew/bin/gs"; \
export GS_QUALITY="ebook"; \
export R_QPDF="/opt/homebrew/bin/qpdf"; \
R --no-init-file CMD build --resave-data --compact-vignettes=both $(PKG_NAME)

With the same results.

2. Submit to win-builder (same result seen on actual CRAN submission).  The (partial) report is:

* checking sizes of PDF files under 'inst/doc' ... WARNING
  'gs+qpdf' made some significant size reductions:
     compacted 'Vig_02_Conceptual_Intro_PCA.pdf' from 432Kb to 143Kb
     compacted 'Vig_03_Step_By_Step_PCA.pdf' from 414Kb to 101Kb
     compacted 'Vig_04_Scores_Loadings.pdf' from 334Kb to 78Kb
     compacted 'Vig_06_Math_Behind_PCA.pdf' from 558Kb to 147Kb
     compacted 'Vig_07_Functions_PCA.pdf' from 381Kb to 90Kb
  consider running tools::compactPDF(gs_quality = "ebook") on these files,
  or build the source package with --compact-vignettes=both

Note that these are *different* vignettes than those compacted during build, so build seems to have missed some (?).

3. If I expand the tarball locally, point to the inst directory, and run

tools::compactPDF("doc", gs_quality = "ebook", gs_cmd = "/opt/homebrew/bin/gs", verbose = TRUE)

I get this:

qs_quality="ebook" : use_gs=TRUE, use_qpdf=TRUE

Thank you for providing this data! Somehow, instead of compacting the
PDFs, one of the tools manages to blow them up in size, as much as ~23
times.

Can you try tools::compactPDF() separately with gs_quality = 'none'
(isolating qpdf) and with qpdf = '' (isolating GhostScript)?

If the culprit turns out to be GhostScript, it may be due to their
rewritten PDF rendering engine (now in C instead of PostScript with
special extensions) not being up to par when the PDF file needs to be
compressed. If it turns out to be qpdf, we might have to extract the
exact command lines and compare results further.

Thank you so much Ivan for investigating.  I didn?t even notice the *increase*!  The results of the tests you requested are very interesting:

R > tools::compactPDF("doc", gs_quality = "none", verbose = TRUE)
qs_quality="none" : use_gs=FALSE, use_qpdf=TRUE
#{pdf}s = length(paths) = 8

    ==> (new=39131)/(old=39131) = 1 .. not worth using

Looks like my version of qpdf (which I think shipped with R) can?t reduce the sizes.

R > tools::compactPDF("doc", gs_quality = "ebook", gs_cmd = "/opt/homebrew/bin/gs", verbose = TRUE, qpdf = "")
qs_quality="ebook" : use_gs=TRUE, use_qpdf=FALSE
#{pdf}s = length(paths) = 8

    ==> (new=41780)/(old=39131) = 1.0677 .. not worth using

So my version of gs blows things up!

Also modified the above using gs_quality = ?printer? or ?screen? and the results are very similar.

> So my version of gs blows things up!

The relatively good news is that GhostScript is not solely to blame. A
fresh build of "GPL Ghostscript 10.03.0 (2024-03-06)" was able to
reduce the files to 16..70% of their original size on my computer. But
I just typed ./configure && make and relied on the dependencies already
present on my system.

We can try to compare the build settings (which will involve compiling
things by hand) or ask the Homebrew people [*] (and they will probably
ask for a PDF file and a specific command line that works on some
builds of gs-10.03.0 but not with Homebrew).

What would you rather do?

qpdf, on the other hand, results in no size reduction (99.7% or worse),
just like on your system.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Extending proj with proj.line3d methods and
 overloading the methods
Message-ID: <DBAP192MB09568DD96FD61DDD801196DB84162@DBAP192MB0956.EURP192.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Dear List-Members,

I try to implement a proj.line3d method and to overload this method as follows:

proj.line3d <- function(p, x, y, z, ...)
  UseMethod("proj.line3d")

proj.line3d.numeric = function(p, x, y, z, ...) {
  # ...
}

proj.line3d.matrix = function(p, x, y, z, ...) {
  # ...
}

The code is available on GitHub, specifically in:
https://github.com/discoleo/Rpdb/blob/main/R/proj.R


However, I encountered various issues both with running proj.line3d and with documenting the functions in order to pass the CRAN-checks.

# ERROR: Executing function

p = c(1,2,3)
line = matrix(c(0,5,2,3,1,4), 2)
proj.line3d(p, line)
#  Error in UseMethod("proj.line3d") :
#   no applicable method for 'proj.line3d' applied to an object of class "c('double', 'numeric')"

I do prefer to have the methods named as "proj._name_" so that they are easily searchable using methods(proj). It's possible to project a point on a line, or a point on a plane, or other more complex projections. Therefore, more methods are possible in the future.

methods(proj)
# [1] proj.aov*           proj.aovlist*       proj.default*       proj.line3d
# [5] proj.line3d.matrix  proj.line3d.numeric proj.lm

I think it is wise to solve first this issue before solving the documentation issues.

Many thnaks,

Leonard

In your NAMESPACE, you've registered methods for the generic function 'proj', classes 'line3d.matrix' and 'line3d.numeric', but above you are calling a different generic, 'proj.line3d', for which no methods are registered.

For proj.line3d(<numeric>, <matrix>) to work, you'll have to register the methods for the proj.line3d generic. If you need a visible connection to the proj() generic, you can try registering a method on the 'proj' generic, class 'line3d' *and* creating a class 'line3d' that would wrap your vectors and matrices:

proj(line3d(p), line) -> call lands in proj.line3d -> maybe additional dispatch on the remaining classes of 'p'?

This seems to work, but I haven't tested it extensively:

> proj.line3d <- \(x, ...) UseMethod('proj.line3d')
> proj.line3d.numeric <- \(x, ...) { message('proj.line3d.numeric'); x }

Dear Ivan,

Thank you very much for the response.

Indeed, I was skeptical how R interprets class names and I have supposed it a little bit different.

S3 methods are more like overloaded functions; while S4 methods are more like true methods implemented for a class. But this is very approximate (with many exceptions and anomalies); and many programmers are not used to think like this.

The "proj" class could have both overloaded functions (e.g. for aov class, ...), and also new methods like projection of a point on a line, or projection of a point on a plane (which are still projections).

This is why I intended to define a new method "proj.line3d" and overload this method. But it seems that R interprets "line3d.numeric" as a class - which originates probably from the "data,frame" class.

How can I define a real method "proj.line3d"?
There might be some limitations from Roxygen as well (as I use it for the package); but it might be easier to proceed, once I understand how to do it in R.

I thought that this solves the problem:
proj.line3d <- function(p, x, y, z, ...)
  UseMethod("proj.line3d")

And maybe it did what I intended. But I need to "register" the overloaded functions somehow differently?

The other solution, as you pointed out, is more cumbersome; and it needs 2 separate classes, so I would need to define "proj" as an S4 class (as S3 does not handle 2 classes at once).


Thank you very much,

Leonard

It may help to call the original 'proj' function and your new
'proj.line3d' function "generics", because that's what most S3
literature calls these functions that you overload. This separates them
from the "methods" 'proj.line3d.numeric' and 'proj.line3d.matrix' that
can be said to "implement" or "overload" the generic.

A concise but very readable guide to S3 and other built-in OOP systems
in R can be found in Advanced R by Hadley Wickham:
http://adv-r.had.co.nz/OO-essentials.html#s3

> How can I define a real method "proj.line3d"?

In order to export an S3 generic and register methods for it from a
package, you need the following directives in your NAMESPACE:

export(proj.line3d)
S3method(proj.line3d, numeric) # will use function proj.line3d.numeric
S3method(proj.line3d, matrix) # similar

<https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Registering-S3-methods>

> There might be some limitations from Roxygen as well (as I use it for
> the package); but it might be easier to proceed, once I understand

The roxygen2 documentation says that if there are multiple dots in the
name of a function, you need to use the two-argument form of the
@method keyword: @method proj.line3d numeric (untested).
<https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/rd-other.html#s3>

> I thought that this solves the problem:
> proj.line3d <- function(p, x, y, z, ...)
>   UseMethod("proj.line3d")

Right. This is the definition of an S3 generic generic in R. As long as
all the methods will also accept arguments (p, x, y, z, <maybe extra
arguments here>, <dots>), all will be fine.

> The other solution, as you pointed out, is more cumbersome; and it

Moreover, you still need an exported generic proj.line3d and registered
methods for it to work. Inheritance does work in S3 (see NextMethod()),
but it alone won't help you call proj.line3d.numeric() from proj() and
'numeric' x.

Executive summary:

This morning my software up-dater (Ubuntu 22.04.4) prompted me to
install updated versions of some software, including r-base.  I thereby
obtained what I believe is the latest version of R (4.4.0 (2024-04-24)).

Then I could not load the "devtools" package, which is fairly crucial to
my work.

A bit of web-searching got me to a post on github by Henrik Bengtsson,
which referred to the devtools problem.  I therefore decided to try
installing devtools from github:

    remotes::install_github("r-lib/devtools",lib="/home/rolf/Rlib")

Some 50-odd packages seemed to require up-dating.  I went for it, and
after a fairly long wait, while messages about the updating flowed by,
devtools seemed to get installed.  Now "library(devtools)" runs without
error, so I am happy with my own situation.  However there seems to be
a problem with the devtools package on CRAN, which ought to be fixed.

cheers,

Rolf Turner

I somehow have not shared this experience.  But then I compile on my
machines (Ubuntu 22.04.4) R and packages from source.

For me the devtools package from CRAN seems to work fine with R 4.4.0

> [...] I thereby obtained what I believe is the latest version of R

Well, what happens if you start R and enter "R.version"?  That should
confirm whether you run R 4.4.0. :)

If you run R 4.4.0 but previously ran R 4.3.x then you are running now
a version with a new minor version number.  AFAIK, there is no
guarantee that at the interface level to compiled code R versions
remain compatible when the minor version number changes.

So on machines where I do not compile from source, I usually run
"update.packages(checkBuilt=TRUE)" whenever I upgrade R on those
machines, definitely if the upgrade involves a change in the major or
minor version number. 

Did you try updating your packages?

Well, you probably first want to find out where exactly the Debian R
distribution installs additional packages (Dirk might help there), and
it might be that you have to run either (or all) of:

update.packages(lib="/usr/local/lib/R/site-library", checkBuilt=TRUE)
update.packages(lib="/usr/lib/R/site-library", checkBuilt=TRUE)
update.packages(lib="/usr/lib/R/library", checkBuilt=TRUE)

though, by a short look at my Ubuntu machine, it may be that the last
two locations are not writeable for you as user, and the first one only
if you belong to the group "staff" as normal user on your machine.

Could you provide a link?  I could not find anything relevant. :)

> However there seems to be a problem with the devtools package on

Or, perhaps, just that the interface to compiled code changed from R
3.6.x to R 4.4.0 and, hence, all packages that rely on compiled code
must be reinstalled.

Stay safe.

Cheers,

	Berwin

Rolf,

what do you mean by "broken"? Since you failed to include any proof nor details it's unlikely that anyone can help you, but chances are pretty high that it was a problem on your end. I just checked with R 4.4.0 on Ubuntu 22.04 and devtools install and load just fine, so it is certainly broken on CRAN.

Make sure you don't have packages for old R version in your local libraries - that is a most common mistake - always remove them when upgrading R and re-install if still need them. You can check the locations of your libraries with .libPaths() in R. Sometimes, update.packages(checkBuilt=TRUE) can do the trick as well, but I prefer clean re-installs for safety as it also helps you clean up old cruft that is not longer needed.

Cheers,
Simon

I also had the problem that devtools didn't install.

I used update.packages(ask =FALSE) and that solved the problem.

Before that I tried to locate the culprit but it was not one of the direct dependencies of devtools.

Rolf,

This question might have been more appropriate for r-sig-debian than here.
But as Simon noted, the lack of detail makes is difficult to say anything to
aid. It likely was an issue local to your setup and use.

These days, I strongly recommend r2u [1].  As you already use R via CRAN
through apt, r2u adds one more repository after which _all_ R packages are
handled via the same apt operations that you already trust to get you R from
CRAN (as well as anything else on your machine).  This covers all 20+
thousand CRAN packages along with 400 key BioC packages. Handling your
packages with your system package managed guarantees all dependencies are
resolved reliably and quickly. It makes installing, upgrading, managing CRAN
package easier, faster and more reliable.

To double-check, I just spot-checked 'devtools' on an r2u container (on top
of Ubuntu 22.04) and of course devtools install and runs fine (as a binary).
So maybe give r2u a go. "Sixteen million packages served" in two years ...

Cheers, Dirk

and ran

   install.packages("devtools",lib="/home/rolf/Rlib")  
 
No error message this time; the install went just fine.
The explanation may lie in the plethora of packages that I re-installed
when I invoked

   remotes::install_github("r-lib/devtools",lib="/home/rolf/Rlib")

This probably relates to Simon Urbanek's advice to re-install all
packages in my local library.  Which I will make sure to do in future.

Previously I got an error message from

    install.packages("devtools",lib="/home/rolf/Rlib")  
 
but now of course I cannot reproduce it.

<SNIP>

Sounds promising, but I cannot follow what "r2u" is actually
all about.  What *is* r2u?  And how do I go about using it?  Do I
invoke it (or invoke something) from within R?  Or do I invoke
something from the OS?  E.g. something like

sudo apt-get install <what???>

???

I have downloaded the file add_cranapt_jammy.sh and executed

   sudo sh add_cranapt_jammy.sh

which seemed to run OK.  What now?

cheers,

Rolf

You could peruse the documentation at

  https://eddelbuettel.github.io/r2u

and / or the blogposts I have especially below

  https://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/blog/code/r4/

(and you may have to read 'in reverse order').

|

| 
| which seemed to run OK.  What now?

Briefly, when you setup r2u you set up new a new apt repo AND a new way to
access them from R (using the lovely `bspm` package).  So in R saying
`install.packages("devtools")` will seamlessly fetch r-cran-devtools and
about 100 other files it depends upon (if you start from an 'empty' system as
I did in a container last eve before replying to you). That works in mere
seconds. You can then say `library(devtools)` as if you compiled locally.

Naturally, using binaries both way faster and easier when it works (as this
generally does). See the blog posts, see the demos, see the r2u site, try in
(risklessly !!) in a container or at gitpod or in continuous integration or
in codespaces or ...
 
The docs try to get to that. Maybe start small and aim `install.packages()`
at a package you know you do not have see what what happens?

Follow-ups may be more appropriate for r-sig-debian, and/or an issue ticket
at the r2u github repo depending on nature of the follow-up.

Good luck,  Dirk

Presumably the install.packages() invocation did not produce an error
message but a subsequent "library(devtools)" did?

I am not sure how remotes::install_github() behaves.  Are you using R
directly or via RStudio?  RStudio redefines the behaviour of
install.packages() so I am not sure what would happen if you type that
command into an R session running in RStudio.

As far as I remember, R's install.packages(), as you would invoke it if
you used R directly, installs the requested packages and any of its
(Depends/Imports) dependencies if these dependencies do not exist in
your libraries.  As devtool's dependencies must have existed on your
system, your command only re-installed devtools but none of the
dependencies.  

And it must be one of the dependencies that uses compiled code and
created the problem, as a "packageDescription("devtools")" actually
shows "NeedsCompilation: no".

You should really execute an
	update.packages(lib="/home/rolf/Rlib", checkBuilt=TRUE)
whenever you upgrade your R version, definitely when the upgrade
involves changing the major/minor version. 

Cheers,

	Berwin

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] re-exporting plot method?
Message-ID: <422b1f93-c779-40fd-a492-c6656960b354@gmail.com>

Hi,

I am working on a new package that primarily makes use of "igraph" 
representations of certain mathematical graphs, in order to apply lots 
of the comp sci algorithms already implemented in that package. For 
display purposes, my "igraph" objects already include information that 
defines node shapes and colors and edge styles and colors. But, I 
believe that the "graph" - "Rgraphviz" - "graphNEL" set of tools will 
produce better plots of the graphs.

So, I wrote my own "as.graphNEL" function that converts the "igraph" 
objects I want to use into graphNEL (or maybe into "Ragraph") format in 
order to be able to use their graph layout and rendering routines. This 
function is smart enough to translate the node and edge attributes from 
igraph into something that works correctly when plotted using the tools 
in Rgraphviz. (My DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE files already import the set 
of functions from Rgraphviz necessary to make this happen.)

In principle, I'd like the eventual user to simply do something like

library("KevinsNewPackage")
IG <- makeIgraphFromFile(sourcefile)
GN <- as.graphNEL(IG)
plot(GN)

The first three lines work fine, but the "plot" function only works if 
the user also explicitly includes the line

library("Rgraphviz")

I suspect that there is a way with imports and exports in the NAMESPACE 
to make this work without having to remind the user to load the other 
package. But (in part because the plot function in Rgraphviz is actually 
an S4 method, which I don't need to alter in any way), I'm not sure 
exactly what needs to be imported or exported.

Helpful suggestion would be greatly appreciated.

Best,
 ? Kevin

Kevin,

welcome to the S4 world! ;) There is really no good solution since S4 only works at all if you attach the package since it relies on replacing the base S3 generic with its own - so the question remains what are your options to do it.

The most obvious is to simply add Depends: Rgraphviz which makes sure that any generics required are attached so your package doesn't need to worry. This is the most reliable in a way as you are not limiting the functionality to methods you know about. The side-effect, though, (beside exposing functions the user may not care about) is that such package cannot be on CRAN since Rgraphics is not on CRAN (that said, you mentioned you are already importing then you seem not to worry about that).

The next option is to simply ignore Rgraphviz and instead add setGeneric("plot") to your package and add methods to Depends and importFrom(methods, setGeneric) + exportMethods(plot) to the namespace. This allows you to forget about any dependencies - you are just creating the S4 generic from base::plot to make the dispatch work. This is the most light-weight solution as you only cherry-pick methods you need and there are no dependencies other than "methods". However, it is limited to just the functions you care about.

Finally, you could re-export the S4 plot generic from Rgraphviz, but I'd say that is the least sensible option, since it doesn't have any benefit over doing it yourself and only adds a hard dependency for no good reason. Also copying functions from another package opens up a can of worms with versions etc. - even if the risk is likely minimal.

Just for completeness - a really sneaky way would be to export an S3 plot method from your package - it would be only called in the case where the plot generic has not been replaced yet, so you could "fix" things on the fly by calling the generic from Rgraphviz, but that sounds a little hacky even for my taste ;).

Cheers,
Simon

Message-ID: <CAM2gKPbHwVi4PiDOYK=r5NCVozN-4sJonp5FqeL0Jy5Xpm6N8g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Is the `.External2()` function part of the public API, and can it be used
in R packages submitted to CRAN? I would like to start using it in a
package, and there *are* packages on CRAN which use it. But its man page
[1] calls it ?internal?, R-exts doesn?t mention it at all (unlike `.C()`,
`.Call()` and `.External()`), and it doesn?t have any actual documentation.
In the context of the recent tightening of the C API CRAN rules, this makes
me concerned that `.External2()` might be next on the chopping block.

.External2() is not in the API and is not intended to be used in
packages.  Packages that for whatever reason have chosen to use it
could instead use .External(), and that is what yo should use. I don't
expect that to be enforced by the check code soon, but it might be.

[.External2() exists for historical reason to ease moving things that
used to be primitives in base out into packages where they fit more
naturally. It could be removed now, but I don't think that is high on
anyone's priority list.]

Best,

luke

Unfortunately .External() is not a replacement (in general, or for my
purpose) since it?s missing the `call` and `rho` arguments, and computing
the same information without these arguments in C code is far from trivial.

The call you would get is not likely to be all that useful, but it is
the one you wrote. The environment is the one you get from environment()
at the point where you would call .External2. So instead of

.External2("foo", x, y)

do

.External("foo", quote(.External2("foo", x, y)), environment(), x, y)

and adjust your C function accordingly.

Hi Luke,

Thanks, obviously that will work and I didn?t think of it.

In my defence I had previously used match.call() to capture the call on the
R side, and representative microbenchmarks show that it adds a prohibitive
overhead for my use-case. On the C side I only need the caller information
in the non-performance sensitive path (for error message formatting) so I
can compute it on demand. And I hadn?t included .External2() in that
benchmark yet. I assume that it?ll be no faster than the way you proposed,
so it isn?t actually needed in my case ? just as you said.

Hi Simon,

Thanks for the detailed answer. I had considered all those 
possibilities, and was hoping that I had just missed something obvious.

I have been using S4 classes in my own packages for quite a while. But 
here, I didn't see any need to create my own class. Now, I may make my 
own, which presents a more abstract "graph" that can have realizations 
both as 'igraph' or "graphNEL' - 'Rargaph'. I'll have to think about, 
but that seems like the only reliable way to prevent putting al of 
Rgraphviz into the user's namespace.

Oh, and CRAN doesn't complain about importing Rgraphviz, since 
BioConductor is one of the "standard mainstream" repositories.

Best,
 ? Kevin

This allows you to forget about any dependencies - you are just creating the S4 generic from base::plot to make the dispatch work. This is the most light-weight solution as you only cherry-pick methods you need and there are no dependencies other than "methods". However, it is limited to just the functions you care about.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Urgent Review of R Packages in Light of Recent RDS
 Exploit
Message-ID: <CA+h+x0bDA3oOprQbB4pkA3WvqHOTR156zAikXhrs0OS7uAcP1g@mail.gmail.com>

I hope this message finds you well.

Following the recent announcement of a vulnerability related to the
RDS exploit in R
(https://hiddenlayer.com/research/r-bitrary-code-execution/).
Recent discussions on social media have raised concerns about the
credibility of the R language. Any code, including pure R code, can
potentially be malicious if it is executed without proper scrutiny.
It is worth noting that a similar problem was reported for the Python
pickle a few years ago:
https://hiddenlayer.com/research/weaponizing-machine-learning-models-with-ransomware/#Exploiting-Serialization.

In my opinion, not an exploit is a central problem, but if it is
introduced in any CRAN package.

I believe we must conduct a comprehensive review of all existing CRAN
packages. Additionally, I will expect an introduction of an additional
step in the R CMD check process. It is stated that R Team is aware of
that, and the exploit is fixed in R 4.4.0, but I can not find any
clear bullet point in the NEWS file for 4.4.0
(https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/NEWS.html).

I look forward to your thoughts and collaborating closely on this urgent review.

Why now? R packages are already code. You don't need poisoned RDS files
to wreak havoc using an R package.

On the other hand, R data files contain R objects, which contain code.
You don't need exploits to smuggle code inside an R object.

What exactly would you like this step to be?

This has recently been discussed in the R-help thread:
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2024-May/479287.html

It may be worth teaching people that in general, R data files should be
as trusted as R code.

It may also be worth setting aside a strict subset of the R data format
to carry data only, without any executable code [*], but it may turn
out to be much less useful than it sounds. For example, you won't be
able to save many kinds of model objects using this plain data format,
which makes it unrealistic to require plain data only inside data files
in CRAN packages.

An independent review of the whole >20000 packages on CRAN for
malicious behaviour is a noble endeavour, but it will require people
and funding. Perhaps you could try to apply for an R Consortium
infrastructure grant to do that.

Dear Ivan,

Thank you for such a quick response.
?It may be worth teaching people that, in general, R data files should be
as trusted as R code.? I totally agree and that why I wrote that any code can be dangerous if run without proper scrutiny. 
A few linkedin post generated most probably by Chat GPT (a lot of icons in them) make a lot of harm lastly. For sure I will try to make a post in my community and will remind that any code can be dangerous. 

BTW. we can limit the possible scan with crandb downloads stats to only those which have more than x downloads a day:) I image it will be a demanding project.

Hey All,

Once more, Ivan, thank you for your great blog post.
I found the https://github.com/hrbrmstr/rdaradar solution and ran it on the
100 most downloaded R packages.
Happily, all data/inst rda files are safe/non-exposed to RDS exploit (using
the linked solution).
Please access my fork for the results
https://github.com/Polkas/rdaradar/blob/main/cran_top_results.txt and the
run https://github.com/Polkas/rdaradar/blob/main/iter_all.R

It will be great to run it on all CRAN packages, but I imagine we should be
sure that the check is decent enough to not overload the servers without a
need.

Message-ID: <DU2PR05MB10863FF6B2A05EFDB63B7D731AC1F2@DU2PR05MB10863.eurprd05.prod.outlook.com>

Hi,

I have an R library with C code in it. It has failed the CRAN checks for Debian.  The problem is with the error function being undefined. Section 6.2 of the Writing R extensions (see below) suggests error handling can be handled by error and the appropriate header file is included in R.h, but this seems not to be the case?

Any help would be appreciated!

Thanks,

Jarrod

6.2 Error signaling

The basic error signaling routines are the equivalents of stop and warning in R code, and use the same interface.

void error(const char * format, ...);
void warning(const char * format, ...);
void errorcall(SEXP call, const char * format, ...);
void warningcall(SEXP call, const char * format, ...);
void warningcall_immediate(SEXP call, const char * format, ...);

These have the same call sequences as calls to printf, but in the simplest case can be called with a single character string argument giving the error message. (Don?t do this if the string contains ?%? or might otherwise be interpreted as a format.)

These are defined in header R_ext/Error.h included by R.h.

Most functions in R have a prefix on their name, with aliases defined so 
you can use the function without the prefix.  But you can turn off the 
aliasing, in which case you need the true name.  I think for all of the 
functions you list the prefix is "Rf_", so they are "Rf_error", etc.

Perhaps you turned off the aliasing?

This is a bit useful - knowing that there are no obvious exploits in
the 100 most downloaded CRAN packages is better that not knowing that - 
but it is important to keep the big picture in mind. Bob himself said
that the script is "super basic". Currently, it only checks whether an
*.rda file, when loaded in the global environment, would shadow certain
important functions. This is not an attack a package author would
perform; this is something one would send directly to the victim.

In order to defeat an attacker, you must think like an attacker.

Here's someone jokingly describing how they would trojan the world's
online shop checkout systems if they wanted to commit financial crimes:
https://archive.ph/FCdBu
(With kindness and pull requests.)

Here's someone spending two years to plant a fake maintainer with a
backdoor in a key free software project:
https://lwn.net/Articles/967192/
(The backdoor was assembled from obfuscated "test files for the
decompressor".)

Here's the 2015 Underhanded C Contest, where people competed in writing
the most harmless-looking code that would instead do something
nefarious: http://www.underhanded-c.org/

On the one hand, hiding the bad functions in a data file (which is
compressed and binary) instead of the R files (which are plain text and
indexed everywhere) would be the obvious first step, so it may be
useful to flag data files with functions in them for human review.

On the other hand, an evil package author has so many tools at their
disposal that they may not need this one in particular. There are CRAN
packages with tens of megabytes of compiled code inside. Sneaking a
little extra something in a file starting with "// This is generated
grammar parser. Do not edit!" followed by an impenetrable wall of C
could be easier and stay undetected for longer. How many packages use
Java? You don't even have to ship the Java source together with an R
package, so one of your *.jars could have a poisoned dependency with
nobody being the wiser.

Attackers are very cunning, and we don't even know what exactly we are
looking for. We can automate some of it, but the kind of code review
that will spot an evil function tucked 50 layers inside a giant
auxiliary data object is a lot of effort, hours to days per package.

This probably counts as creating an unofficial CRAN mirror:
https://cran.r-project.org/mirror-howto.html

(I remember someone sending too many requests to download packages one
my one and losing access from a university address to CRAN as a result.)

You'll need 12.7 Gb for the current versions of the packages or >400 Gb
for the whole archive.

I agree with Ivan here. And more generally, R is a fully featured
programming language. You don't need just this one "exploit" (though, it
really does feel like a feature to some degree lol!) to be a bad guy with
R.

You can link to a pre-compiled binary (like my team makes for an R package
that contains proprietary code
https://github.com/R-ArcGIS/r-bridge/tree/master/libs/x64) and call
completely compiled function that have bad side effects. You can initialize
a logger in `.onLoad()` or have a function that sends your data to someone
using httr quietly while doing something actually useful.

There are also fairly widely used R packages that exist on GitHub/Lab or
r-universe or elsewhere.

You'd be taking on a  sisyphean task trying to route out all the evil code
from the R world.
There's also likely little to none of it (shouts out to CRAN maintainers

Yes, this may have hit the news as a problem but any code anywhere can be a security issue.

If you want to read lots of R code and also the code for add-ins from libraries and compile everything from scratch with a  trusted set of tools, and refuse to open any of the files being discussed and so on, and only use packages on your machine and already examined, sure. You can be a tad safer.

But as shown for years, it is quite possible to obfuscate the code in many languages to the point where you may not easily figure out what the code will do! And most people cannot and will not read source code as at some point it is easier to do what they want another way.

What is sort of new here is a level of indirection that happens because of the way you can store things in a file and read them in so they execute. But is it all that much more dangerous than regular R code that opens up some remote file or reads records from a database and then does an eval() on the random text?

Having said that, this is a bit like the Virus Detection industry. You may scan files in endless ways to recognize a KNOWN signature and then find lots of false positives too. Obviously places like CRAN might be able to do a scan on files in packages, or maybe you could open files with a wrapper that checks the innards for known dangers. But unless this becomes a widely used exploitation before it is fixed, ...

I agree with Ivan here. And more generally, R is a fully featured
programming language. You don't need just this one "exploit" (though, it
really does feel like a feature to some degree lol!) to be a bad guy with
R.

You can link to a pre-compiled binary (like my team makes for an R package
that contains proprietary code
https://github.com/R-ArcGIS/r-bridge/tree/master/libs/x64) and call
completely compiled function that have bad side effects. You can initialize
a logger in `.onLoad()` or have a function that sends your data to someone
using httr quietly while doing something actually useful.

There are also fairly widely used R packages that exist on GitHub/Lab or
r-universe or elsewhere.

You'd be taking on a  sisyphean task trying to route out all the evil code
from the R world.
There's also likely little to none of it (shouts out to CRAN maintainers
for being really good at what they do even if it does grind my gears
sometimes ??)

I think the confusion arises because users expect "R data files" to only 
contain data, i.e. numbers, but they can contain any R object, including 
functions.

I, personally, never use them out of concern that accidentally saved 
function can override some functionality and be difficult to debug. And, 
of course, I never save R sessions.

If you need to pass data it is a good idea to use some common format like 
tab-separated CSV files with column names. One can also use MVL files 
(RMVL package).

Thank you all for the discussion.
Then, we should promote "code awareness" and count on the CRAN Team to
continue their great work:)

What do you think about promoting containers?
Nowadays, containers are more accessible, with GitHub codespaces being more
affordable (mostly free for students and the educational sector).
I feel containers can help a little bit in making the R work more
secure, but once more when used properly.

Containers have an attack surface too, have user experience problems
(how's Docker on Windows?) and may bring in more third-party code than
what you're trying to protect against (whole operating system images!).
Even Firejail and Bubblewrap, containers specifically designed to
sandbox untrusted code, have bugs in their setup or implementation
every now and then.

Still, you are welcome to run third-party code in a virtual machine or
a container. It may be not everyone's favourite trade-off, but is a net
increase in security over running untrusted code directly. Feel free to
search for a point on the Pareto optimal line between security and
convenience that you'll be comfortable with: https://xkcd.com/2044/

The GitHub-isation of the development process is kind of a
vulnerability too, or at the very least has a cost. I'm a few
handshakes away from several people who have been disappeared from
GitHub and couldn't get their accounts back. Microsoft is too big to
have real tech support [*], so once you fall foul of their AI
moderation systems, you'll have to be a Hacker News celebrity to
attract attention of a human on the inside.

I've got an ageing ThinkPad that I cannot afford to replace. It can
process all the data I've been gathering during my PhD and then some,
least squares, inverse problems, you name it, all while playing music
and having Quake I open. But the moment I try to launch Codespaces, it
downloads more bytes of JavaScript than the whole Quake I installation
takes in size, and then the browser overheats the laptop.

Maybe programming other people's computers in the browser is the
future, but then you need a fancy laptop and maybe a friend in
Microsoft just to be admitted into that future. A solution for some,
but not for all.

flagging an error because I have a dependency on phyloseq, which is available through GitHub but not on the CRAN site. I have a similar problem with microViz, however I?ve managed to make it suggested, rather than required. There is no way to get around the phyloseq requirement. How do I fix this problem so that I can upload my package to the CRAN website? I feel like I had this problem with microViz in the past, but now it?s coming up with phylseq too, and I can?t remove that dependency.

phyloseq is a Bioconductor package. It appears to be available from 
BioConductor, so it doesn't matter that it's not on CRAN.

Have you tried submitting your package to CRAN?  If so, could you show 
us the error you received?

Did a human reviewer tell you to get rid of the dependencies? There is
at least 444 packages on CRAN with strong dependencies on Bioconductor
packages, so your phyloseq dependency should work. In fact, 14 of them
depend on phyloseq.

What you need is an Additional_repositories field in your DESCRIPTION
specifying the source package repository where microViz could be
installed from. I think that

Additional_repositories: https://david-barnett.r-universe.dev

...should work.

Besides that, you'll need to increment the version and list the *.Rproj
file in .Rbuildignore:
https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/HybridMicrobiomes_0.1.1_20240504_173331/Debian/00check.log

I think it is not a good idea to focus on one use case. Some people will 
find containers more convenient some don't.

If you want security, I am sure containers are not the right approach - 
get a separate physical computer instead.

>From a convenience point of view containers are only ok as long as you 
don't need to interface with outside software, then it gets tricky as the 
security keeping things containerized starts interfering with getting work 
done. (Prime example: firefox snap on ubuntu)

One situation where containers can be helpful is distribution of 
commercial applications. Containers allow you to freeze library versions, 
so your app can still run with old C library or a specific version of 
Python. You can then _hope_ that containers will have fewer compatibility 
issues, or at least you can sell containers to your management on this 
idea.

But this is not really a good thing for an open source project like R.

Hey Vladimir,

Thank you for your answer.
GitHub codespaces are "a separate computer" and are free for students and
the educational sector.
The GitHub codespaces are a cloud service that can be created anytime, with
a specific setup behind it (Dockerfile, settings.json, renv.lock,  ...).
The machines GitHub codespaces offer are quite decent (4core 16GB RAM 32GB
Memory).
You can destroy and recreate it anytime you want to.
You run GitHub codespaces from a web browser, but as Ivan stated, you may
need a decent computer to handle them, even if all calculations are done on
the cloud.
I use GitHub codespaces for all my University projects with my friends.  It
is great that I do not have to explain many things nowadays to older stuff
as many things are automatic on GitHub codespaces.

  This is true, and useful.

   Many old-school R users are nervous about coming to rely on tools 
that are controlled by a company that may rescind that availability in 
the future, or may possibly use your code in ways you don't want (I have 
not gone all the way through 
https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement 
...)

    For example, Travis was great for CI for a while then pulled the 
plug on free use for public repos, then everyone jumped to GitHub 
actions ...; Microsoft Open R and MRAN were around for a while and then 
weren't ...

   That doesn't mean one should necessarily avoid these tools; it just 
explains why some people do.

Hi Maciej,

    What I was suggesting is that instead of encapsulating the application 
in a container that runs on the same physical hardware as other 
containers, you would be more secure to use a dedicated computer for the 
application.

I noticed a note on RMVL package check page for development version of R:

Found non-API call to R: ?SETLENGTH?

Is this something that is work-in-progress for the development version, or 
has SETLENGTH() been deprecated ? What should I use instead ?

thank you very much

SETLENGTH has never been part of the API. It is not safe to use except
in a very, very limited set of circumstances. Using it in other
settings will confuse the memory manager, leading at least to
mis-calculation of memory use information and possibly to
segfaults. For most uses I have seen, copying to a new vector of the
right size is the only safe option.

The one context where something along these lines might be OK is for
growable vectors. This concept is emphatically not in the API at this
point, and the way it is currently implemented in base is not robust
enough to become an API (even though some packages have used it). It
is possible that a proper API for this will be added; at that point
SETLENGTH will be removed from the accessible entry points on
platforms that allow this.

So if you are getting a note about SETLENGTH, either stop using it or
be prepared to make some changes at fairly short notice.

[Similar considerations apply to SET_TRUELENGT. In most but not all
cases using it is less dangerous, but you should still look for other
options if you want your code to continue to work.]

Great, thank you for the explanation ! I will rewrite the code to not use 
SETLENGTH().

My use case was to allocate a vector of some size N_max and then 
repeatedly populate it with variable number of elements. Since the vector 
was protected during the loop, I would have expected to save on memory 
allocation calls.

Jarrod,

could you point us to the code? There is not much to go by based on your email. One thing just in general: it's always safer to not re-map function names, especially since "error" can be defined in many random other headers, so it's better to use Rf_error() instead to avoid confusions with 3rd party headers that may (re-)define the "error" macro (depending on the order you include them in).

Cheers,
Simon

Hi,

Using Rf_error() rather than error() fixed the problem. Not sure why the problem was only flagged on Debian, but it seems to have been triggered by R_NO_REMAP being defined (which will be default in R 4.5.0).

Thanks for the help.

That doesn't work - additional repositories are not allowed on CRAN other than in very exceptional cases, because it means the package cannot be installed by users making it somewhat pointless. Bioconductor doesn't need to be flagged in Additional_repositories, but not all packages are available - only those that do no depend on the data repository.

As for the OP, can you post the name of the package and/or the link to the errors so I can have a look?

Cheers,
Simon

I suppose that with(tools::CRAN_package_db(),
sum(!is.na(Additional_repositories)) / length(Additional_repositories))
= 0.7% does make it very rare. But not even for a weak dependency? Is
it for data packages only, as seems to be the focus of
[10.32614/RJ-2017-026]? The current wording of the CRAN policy makes it
sound like Additional_repositories is preferred to explaining the
non-mainstream weak dependencies in Description.

So what should be done about the non-Bioconductor weak dependency
microViz?

Sharon has since got rid of the WARNING and now only has NOTEs due to
microViz and a URL to its repo in the Description:
https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/HybridMicrobiomes_0.1.2_20240504_185748/Debian/00check.log

If Additional_repositories: is the correct way to specify a
non-mainstream weak dependency for a CRAN package, the URL must be
specified as https://david-barnett.r-universe.dev/src/contrib, not just
https://david-barnett.r-universe.dev/. I am sorry for not getting it
right the first time.

Ivan,

sorry if it wasn't clear, but this thread was about strong dependencies -- Sharon noted that phyloseq must remain strong dependency and asked how to deal with that (see all the parts you cut from this thread). Now that I finally have the package name I can check the details - apparently this only affects R-oldrel so presumable Bioc upgrade may fix this so I'll have a look tomorrow.

Cheers,
Simon

In my Makevars file (linked below) I link to ssl by adding `-lssl` to
`PKG_LIBS`. Since I do this, does libssl need to be added to the System
Requirements field?

Makevars:
https://github.com/R-ArcGIS/arcgisgeocode/blob/8194a478a616f7ddc3a25bcb024c0534007bcd51/src/Makevars#L4

If so, is there a place that contains the standardized descriptions for
some of these more common system requirements? I suspect that means my
SystemRequirements would look a bit like:


SystemRequirements: Cargo (Rust's package manager), rustc, libssl

Is that correct?

Thanks all! I'm a bit out of my depth here!

I've submitted an R package to CRAN and am failing checks *only on Debian*

https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/arcgisutils_0.3.0_20240507_194020/Debian/00check.log


This NOTE does not appear in Ubuntu, Mac, or Windows checks
https://github.com/R-ArcGIS/arcgisutils/actions/runs/8989812276/job/24693685840

I've made an edit to the Makevars to specifically remove this directory,
but it seems to continue to persist.

https://github.com/R-ArcGIS/arcgisutils/blob/ff8a0a1b936e27be16ac866aa16605b973d435c7/src/Makevars#L31-L35

Does anyone know how I can repro this NOTE or have an idea about what is
happening?

I'm a bit at a loss and do not want to use CRAN as if it is a CI
system--its challenging enough as is.

Thanks!

Hi Josiah,

Indeed, the right thing to do is to declare the library in the
SystemRequirements file. However, other than some specific documented
usages which affect how R builds the package (e.g. C++ standards and
GNU make), I believe the field is meant more just to inform users of
the external dependencies required, so they could install those
themselves before attempting to install the package. The R extensions
manual has:

https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#The-DESCRIPTION-file
> Dependencies external to the R system should be listed in the ?SystemRequirements? field, possibly amplified in a separate README file. This includes specifying a non-default C++ standard and the need for GNU make.

Also note that, for any external dependency required by the package,
you should also check its existence in the package configure script.

https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Configure-and-cleanup
> Use this to detect if any nonstandard libraries are present such that corresponding code in the package can be disabled at install time rather than giving error messages when the package is compiled or used.

The curl package (and its dependency on libcurl) is the first thing
that comes to mind and could be a useful reference.

https://github.com/jeroen/curl/blob/master/DESCRIPTION#L21
https://github.com/jeroen/curl/blob/master/configure

Best,
Kevin

That's a bit strange. It fires for me in a local R CMD check for a test
package even without --as-cran. The code performing the check has been
in R since ~2010.

It's too late for Makevars to exclude files from the source package
tarball. Use .Rbuildignore instead:
https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Building-binary-packages

I think that the line src/vendor/chrono/CITATION\\.cff will prevent the
file from appearing in the package tarball.

Sorry, that was mostly misguided. .Rbuildignore won't help with the
contents of the Rust vendor tarball.

1. Can you omit the .cff file from src/rust/vendor.tar.xz when building
it?

2. I think that there is --exclude in both GNU tar and BSD tar. How
about tar --exclude="*.cff" -x -f rust/vendor.tar.xz ?

3. From
<https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/arcgisutils_0.3.0_20240507_194020/Debian/00install.out>,
it can be seen that the "clean" target does not get called. Can you
remove the *.cff file in the same Make target?

Thanks, Ivan!

As you can see, the directory is ignored already
https://github.com/R-ArcGIS/arcgisutils/blob/ff8a0a1b936e27be16ac866aa16605b973d435c7/.Rbuildignore#L14

The directory is created in the Makevars after the zip is untarred:

https://github.com/R-ArcGIS/arcgisutils/blob/ff8a0a1b936e27be16ac866aa16605b973d435c7/src/Makevars#L17

Then the directory is removed during the clean phase I believe as well.

I have other packages that use a similar makevars that are in CRAN.

Since I can?t repro it I?m not sure how to debug it without submitting to
CRAN again.

Thanks to @yutannihilation for pointing out that the issue repros on
r-universe
https://github.com/r-universe/r-arcgis/actions/runs/8990426306/job/24695887245
.

Do folks know if there are any templates for the linux CRAN check? It
appears that the r-lib/actions linux checks don't cover all of the same
bases. I tried cribbing the r-universe one but it is a bit like unwinding a
cat's cradle.

Waiting an hour for each r-universe check is not really an effective
strategy! ?

Message-ID: <CAL3ufULZDHv9aVAnmrE4m-fF_z=UvhkPGiKMYR3ZkQYN7=z+5A@mail.gmail.com>

I am sorry for blowing up this thread lately.

I've submitted a package to CRAN that uses Rust which thus requires
dependencies to be vendored. https://github.com/R-ArcGIS/arcgisutils/

The vendored dependencies are 18mb when zipped and 16.4mb when zipped with
XZ -9e. The *installed package size is 1.2mb* on my Mac.

CRAN has rejected this package with:

*   Size of tarball: 18099770 bytes*

*Please reudce to less than 5 MB for a CRAN package.*


Due to the requirement to vendor my dependencies. I do not see any possible
way to compress 250mb of source code to <= 5mb.

I suspect there are alternatives which have been handled in one-off
situations given that other packages require fairly large system
dependencies e.g. Arrow, DuckDB, torch etc.

How do others handle this?

CRAN policy [1] says: "If the sources are too large, it is acceptable
to download them as part of installation, but do ensure that the
download is of a fixed version rather than the latest." So you could
try downloading the source in your configure script. Though be careful
not to be bitten by this other line from the policy: "Packages which
use Internet resources should fail gracefully with an informative
message if the resource is not available or has changed (and not give
a check warning nor error)."

Hello, 

I just discovered that my package 'refseqR' was removed from the CRAN repository on April 30th. 
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/refseqR/index.html?

This news is extremely upsetting, especially because I did not receive any communication or warning regarding the issue. Could anyone please help me understand the reasons behind this, or suggest any steps I should take to resolve it?

Thanks,

According to the CRAN links
<https://cran-archive.r-project.org/web/checks/2024/2024-04-30_check_results_refseqR.html>,
your package had an error on r-devel-windows-x86_64 and
r-patched-linux-x86_64 which was not addressed. Specifically, some
examples failed. See
<https://cran-archive.r-project.org/web/checks/2024/2024-04-30_check_results_refseqR.html>
for more specific details. Usually, fixing the problem and
incrementing the version is enough to resubmit it to CRAN.

Thanks,

Avi

Here's what I could find in
https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/PACKAGES.in:

>> X-CRAN-Comment: Archived on 2024-04-30 for policy violation.
>>  .
>>  On Internet access.  Also other errors.

So Avi is right, this is about the tests and/or examples failing
(possibly due to problems on the remote server).

If possible, try to emit errors with a special class set for
Internet-related errors. This will make it possible for your examples
and tests to catch them, as in:

tests/*.R:

tryCatch(
 <expression potentially accessing the Internet using your package>,
 refseqR_internet_error = function(e)
  message("Caught Internet-related error")
)

Are you by chance confusing a NOTE (issued, but can be overruled) with a
WARNING (more severe, likely a must-be-addressed) or ERROR?

There are lots and lots of packages larger than 5mb -- see eg

   https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/?C=S;O=D

which has a top-5 of

   rcdklibs       19mb
   fastrmodels    15mb
   prqlr          15mb
   RFlocalfdr     14mb
   acss.data      14mb

and at least one of those is also Rust-using and hence a possible template.

Dirk

Thank you, Dirk. This was a direct email from a CRAN member and not part of
the automatic checks. The whole email is below. I think the intent of the
message is "please resubmit."

Thanks, we see:

Please reudce to less than 5 MB for a CRAN package.



Best,


Yes, prqlr is a great Rust-based package! My other Rust based packages that
are on CRAN are based, in part on prqlr.

Thank you, Neal!

I took some inspiration from the arrow-r github repo and ch 1.2 of the
manual

*If your configure script needs auxiliary files, it is recommended that you
> ship them in a tools directory (as R itself does).*


With ChatGPT's ability to write autoconf, I *think *I have something that
can work.

The configure file runs tools/get-deps.R which will download the
dependencies from the repo if available and verify the checksums.
If the checksums don't match, an error is thrown, otherwise it can
continue. I believe this meets the requirements of CRAN?

You don't have to write autoconf if your configure.ac is mostly a plain
shell script. You can write the configure script itself. Set the PATH
and then exec "${R_HOME}/bin/Rscript" tools/configure.R (in the
regular, non-multiarch configure for Unix-like systems) or exec
"${R_HOME}/bin${R_ARCH_BIN}/Rscript.exe" tools/configure.R (in
configure.win, which you'll also need). You've already wrote the rest
of the code in a language you know well: R.

Autoconf would be useful if you had system-specific dependencies with
the need to perform lots of compile tests. Those would have been a pain
to set up in R. Here you mostly need sys.which() instead of

One of the pain points is the need for a strong, cryptographically
secure hash. MD5 is, unfortunately, no longer such a hash. In a cmake
build, you would be able to use cmake's built in strong hashes (such as
SHA-2 or SHA-3). The CRAN policy doesn't explicitly forbid MD5; it only
requires a "checksum". If you figure out a way to use a strong hash
from tools/configure.R for the downloaded tarball, please let us know.

The other important CRAN requirement is to store the vendor tarball
somewhere as permanent as CRAN itself (see the caveats at the bottom of
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/using_rust.html), that is, not
GitHub. I think that Zenodo counts as a sufficiently reliable store.

Thank you, Ivan, for your really thoughtful feedback! I really appreciate
it!

   - I'll see if there are any base R packages that support SHA-2 or SHA-3.
   - I'll see if I can get the configure.ac to make the appropriate Rscript
   call for configure.win.
      - I think the idea of having a single `confgure.ac` file to generate
      both configure and configure.win is nice. Guidance with GitHub
actions and
      ChatGPT is essentially a must for me since my bash is remedial at best.

Regarding the permanent storage requirement, I find it to be very strange.
I've personally never heard of Zenodo until just now! Does the CRAN team
have recommendations for what is considered "as sufficiently reliable?" I
have repos that have persisted for almost 10 years. I think that is
sufficiently reliable!

The requirement to avoid GitHub feels surprisingly anachronistic given how
central it is to the vast majority of software development. The alternative
I can think of is to create a CDN on cloudflare or something to store the
file independently.

Are there any avenues to have CRAN clarify their positions outside of
one-off processes? It would be quite unfortunate to go through all the work
of creating a way to build, store, and retrieve the dependencies only for
CRAN to decide they don't support it.

Well, the CRAN maintainer has not spotted this is abour rust code. This 
was not indicated in your mail, hence you got  direct rejection.

That's a good point! My apologies for not making that abundantly clear.

Regardless, I think it is a fair ask to not submit massive tarballs of
dependencies.
Clarifying how we might be able to store the dependencies *outside *of CRAN
would be good to figure out.
This would help packages like polars be able to exist on CRAN.

    Zenodo and OSF (see e.g. 
<https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.g4z879>) are both non-profit 
organizations that support archiving -- that is, they both make stronger 
guarantees of permanent availability than GitHub does. Possibly Software 
Heritage https://www.softwareheritage.org/features/ ?

   Zenodo has convenient GitHub integration.

If there are many packages based on Rust that require common code, would 
it make sense to make a single "rust" compatibility package that they can 
depend on ?

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] is Fortran write still strictly forbidden?
Message-ID: <95b62a98-7920-4a36-8339-fce63a89e3e5@gmail.com>

Hello,

I like to use write() in Fortran code to combine text with some integers 
& doubles, to pass runtime information to R in a way that is prettier 
and more legible than with intpr() & dblepr(). In the past any calls to 
write() were strictly forbidden in Fortran code, as apparently it messed 
something up internally (I cannot recall the details). But from 'writing 
R extensions' it seems that there have been quite a few changes with 
respect to support for Fortran code, and it currently reads:


6.5.1 Printing from Fortran

On many systems Fortran|write|and|print|statements can be used, but the 
output may not interleave well with that of C, and may be invisible 
onGUIinterfaces. They are not portable and best avoided.


To be more specific, would the subroutine below be allowed? Is it needed 
to declare R >= 4.0 (?) in the package DESCRIPTION (& then use labelpr() 
instead of intpr() ?) Is there an alternative without write() to get the 
same result?


subroutine Rprint_pretty(iter, x)
 ??? integer, intent(IN) :: iter
 ??? double precision, intent(IN) :: x
 ??? integer :: date_time_values(8), nchar, IntDummy(0)
 ??? character(len=8) :: time_now
 ??? character(len=200) :: msg_to_R

 ??? call date_and_time(VALUES=date_time_values)
 ??? write(time_now, '(i2.2,":",i2.2,":",i2.2)') date_time_values(5:7)
 ??? write(msg_to_R, '(a8, " i: ", i5, "? value: ", f8.2)') time_now, 
iter, x

 ??? nchar = len(trim(msg_to_R))
 ?? call intpr(trim(msg_to_R), nchar, IntDummy, 0)

 ? end subroutine Rprint_pretty


Thanks!

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] flang doesn't support derived types
Message-ID: <6ffdcf71-8ebf-4af3-ac53-fc166092b07b@protonmail.com>

Hello everyone, this is my first post on the mailing list (as well as the first package I'm attempting to publish), so please forgive any obvious errors.

I'm using a lot of Fortran code which relies on derived types to manage data structures. The package compiles fine on Windows, Linux and Mac and passes all checks, including the CI pipeline on GitHub provided by the RStudio folks. However, upon submission I received an automatic reply shortly afterwards saying the build had failed on CRAN's servers for Debian. The log gives the following error:

flang/lib/Lower/CallInterface.cpp:949: not yet implemented: support for polymorphic types

I tried searching this mailing list as well as the llvm docs for a precedent or explanation, without much success. The baffling thing is that my code doesn't use polymorphism at all as far as I can tell, they're just DTs with bound procedures (I don't think the Fortran standard considers this polymorphic?). My question is: what can I do about it? This is a compiler issue, but I doesn't seem from "Writing R Extensions" that CRAN allows you to check the installed compiler and abort the install if an unsupported one is detected. However, it's not really a package developer's fault that the compiler doesn't support the standard.

Thanks in advance,

Othman El Hammouchi

Hi Jisca:

I have used the write successfully.  I?m not sure if this matters or not,
but I am using WSL 2 with Ubuntu 22.04 installed.  It works fine with R =>
4.0.

Hope this helps.

Hi,

I need to serialize and save a 20K x 20K matrix as a binary file. This process is significantly slower in R compared to Python (4X slower).

I'm not sure about the best approach to optimize the below code. Is it possible to parallelize the serialization function to enhance performance?


  n <- 20000^2
  cat("Generating matrices ... ")
  INI.TIME <- proc.time()
  A <- matrix(runif(n), ncol = m)
  END_GEN.TIME <- proc.time()
  arg_ser <- serialize(object = A, connection = NULL)

  END_SER.TIME <- proc.time()
  con <- file(description = "matrix_file", open = "wb")
  writeBin(object = arg_ser, con = con)
  close(con)
  END_WRITE.TIME <- proc.time()
  con <- file(description = "matrix_file", open = "rb")
  par_raw <- readBin(con, what = raw(), n = file.info("matrix_file")$size)
  END_READ.TIME <- proc.time()
  B <- unserialize(connection = par_raw)
  close(con)
  END_DES.TIME <- proc.time()
  TIME <- END_GEN.TIME - INI.TIME
  cat("Generation time", TIME[3], " seconds.")

  TIME <- END_SER.TIME - END_GEN.TIME
  cat("Serialization time", TIME[3], " seconds.")

  TIME <- END_WRITE.TIME - END_SER.TIME
  cat("Writting time", TIME[3], " seconds.")

  TIME <- END_READ.TIME - END_WRITE.TIME
  cat("Read time", TIME[3], " seconds.")

  TIME <- END_DES.TIME - END_READ.TIME
  cat("Deserialize time", TIME[3], " seconds.")




Best,

Hm that is an incomplete specification: _what_ do you want to do with it?
Read it back in R?  Share it with other languages (like Python) ? I.e. what
really is your use case?  Also, you only seem to use readBin / writeBin. Why
not readRDS / saveRDS which at least give you compression?

If it is to read/write from / to R look into the qs package. It is good. The
README.md at its repo has benchmarks: https://github.com/traversc/qs If you
want to index into the stored data look into fst. Else also look at databases

Thanks!


I want to save data from a matrix to a file and then retrieve it later while running R code, all within R.

As long as the compression doesn't result in data loss, it should be suitable for my needs.

I am not aware that there were any recent changes regarding printing
from Fortran recently, or that it was every strictly forbidden (perhaps
it is for packages that are submitted to CRAN?).  In fact, R-exts.texi
for R 1.0.0 states pretty much the same as what you quoted from the
current WRE manual:

  @subsection Printing from Fortran
  @cindex Printing from C

  In theory Fortran @code{write} and @code{print} statements can be
  used, but the output may not interleave well with that of C, and will
  be invisible on GUI interfaces.  They are best avoided.

  Three subroutines are provided to ease the output of information from
  Fortran code.

  @example
  subroutine dblepr(@var{label}, @var{nchar}, @var{data}, @var{ndata})
  subroutine realpr(@var{label}, @var{nchar}, @var{data}, @var{ndata})
  subroutine intpr (@var{label}, @var{nchar}, @var{data}, @var{ndata})
  @end example

Cheers,

Sameh,

if it's a matrix, that's easy as you can write it directly which is the fastest possible way without compression - e.g. quick proof of concept:

n <- 20000^2
A <- matrix(runif(n), ncol = sqrt(n))

## write (dim + payload)
con <- file(description = "matrix_file", open = "wb")
system.time({
writeBin(d <- dim(A), con)
dim(A)=NULL
writeBin(A, con)
dim(A)=d
})
close(con)

## read
con <- file(description = "matrix_file", open = "rb")
system.time({
d <- readBin(con, 1L, 2)
A1 <- readBin(con, 1, d[1] * d[2])
dim(A1) <- d
})
close(con)
identical(A, A1)

   user  system elapsed 
  0.931   2.713   3.644 
   user  system elapsed 
  0.089   1.360   1.451 
[1] TRUE

So it's really just limited by the speed of your disk, parallelization won't help here.

Note that in general you get faster read times by using compression as most data is reasonably compressible, so that's where parallelization can be useful. There are plenty of package with more tricks like mmapping the files etc., but the above is just base R.

Cheers,
Simon

Dear Berwin & Erin,

Thanks for your replies. I should perhaps have clarified - this is for a 
package on CRAN.

In my experience anything with Fortran write will get a NOTE from CRAN's 
auto-check:

Check: compiled code, Result: NOTE
   File 'sequoia/libs/sequoia.so':
     Found '_gfortran_st_write', possibly from 'write' (Fortran), 'print'
       (Fortran)
       Object: 'sequoia.o'
   
   Compiled code should not call entry points which might terminate R nor
   write to stdout/stderr instead of to the console, nor use Fortran I/O
   nor system RNGs.


In the past (2018) I've tried to `write` the iteration number to a char 
to then combine into the message send to R with `dplepr`, but when I 
tried to argue this was a false positive as it wasn't writing to a file 
I got the following reply from UL:

So what I'm wondering now - has the issue with the switch to LF line 
endings been fixed, and is it OK to use non-file `write`? Because I 
don't really want to make the time to figure out how to 'write C 
interface code to do the conversion' just for some prettier messages...


Thanks for your help!

Hi,

Have a look at package nleqslv to see how you can avoid Fortran write completely.
Look at the file src/nwout.c and the calls of various functions therein in the other fortran files.

Berend Hasselman

Parallelization should not help - a single CPU thread should be able to 
saturate your disk or your network, assuming you have a typical computer.

The problem is possibly the conversion to text, writing it as binary 
should be much faster.

To add to other suggestions, you might want to try my package "RMVL" - 
aside from fast writes, it also gives you ability to share data between 
ultimate users of the package.

PS Example:

library("RMVL")

M<-mvl_open("test1.mvl", append=TRUE, create=TRUE)

n <- 20000^2
cat("Generating matrices ... ")
INI.TIME <- proc.time()
A <- matrix(runif(n), ncol = m)
END_GEN.TIME <- proc.time()

mvl_write(M, A, name="A")

mvl_close(M)

END_SER.TIME <- proc.time()


# Use in another script:

library("RMVL")

M2<-mvl_open("test1.mvl")

print(M2$A[1:10, 1:10])

Professor Ripley sent you email on April 16 and asked for a fix within 2

Your use of contained procedures in class(t_mack_triangle) and
class(t_cl_res) signifies the derived types as being extensible and
thus potentially polymorphic. You'll have to replace class(...) with
type(...) and move the contained procedures out of the type definitions
(and maybe additionally make the types 'sequence' or 'bind(C)' to
signify them being non-extensible) to make the code work with flang-18.
I'm afraid this will also prevent you from defining destructors for
these types.

flang-new can be a very disappointing compiler at times [*], but it's
what people do use in the real world, especially for 64-bit ARM
processors, so in order to keep our packages portable, we have to cater
to its whims.

Dear Ivan,

Thank you so much for taking the time. I'd already figured out my misunderstanding on polymorphism in the mean time. The flang limitations are quite unfortunate, especially since there's no way to know this in development. The CI pipeline provided by the RStudio folks uses gfortran, and as far as I know it's the standard compiler in most distributions. Do I understand it correctly that there is no way to specify a Fortran standard in the SystemRequirements? I had resubmitted my package in the mean time with a configure script that aborts the install if the compiler does not support polymorphism, but I understand that this is a fruitless avenue for CRAN?

On the practical side, I did experiment with what you suggested. However, I'm now getting other errors about initialisation of allocatable arrays and the use of intrinsics like isnan, which would be impossible to take out. I should point out my local flang install is version 16, but I cannot install 18 on my system since it's in unstable (this again underscores the problem of developing under these constraints).

What would you advise? And don't you think these Fortran constraints should be better documenten.

Thanks for bearing with me,

Othman El Hammouchi

It's possible (and even recommended) to describe the Fortran version
requirement in SystemRequirements [1], but this field is for now mostly
informational. I think I remember efforts to standardise it, but they
are far from complete.

Signs point to yes, at least judging by a previous time we had
flang-related problems [2]. On the other hand, there were relatively
easy workarounds that time, and here I'm not seeing anything as simple.

Would you consider containers for this purpose? I was able to reproduce
the problem relatively quickly by starting podman run --rm -it
debian:sid and installing flang-18 in there. (Unlike Docker a few years
ago, podman can be installed straight from the repository, at least on
Debian, and doesn't require adding users to special groups in order to
work. Maybe Docker has also improved.) I don't like containers as a
basis for software distribution, but I can't deny that they are being
great at letting me quickly reproduce problems without installing 10
different GNU/Linux distros.

> What would you advise? And don't you think these Fortran constraints

I'm afraid I don't have any more specific advice besides testing your
workarounds with Debian Sid in a container or a virtual machine or a
chroot. I can try to take a look at more concrete problems. I hope you
will be able to find a relatively painless workaround.

I do wish that flang-new would be a better compiler or at least a
better documented one, but instead of a list of features on their
website, I can only see "Getting Involved [3] for tips on how to get in
touch <...> and to learn more about the current status". There is only
so many projects one can get involved in.

Then you might like Kevin Ushey's configure
<https://github.com/kevinushey/configure>, which is like autoconf
redone in R. The only few lines of bash are the system-specific bits in
{configure,cleanup}{.win,} to run the R scripts under tools/, and they
are already written for you.

Generating two system-specific configures from one configure.ac might
be possible - GNU m4 is very versatile - but to implement that, you
would have to program m4, which is even more niche than bash.

I think that Ben Bolker's answer explains it very well. Part of the
goal of the CRAN archive is to be able to take a package, a
period-appropriate version of R and install the former on the latter.
The URL carrying the code must be able to survive as long. Unlike
Zenodo, GitHub's goal is not directly to provide storage forever, and
its current owners have a reputation [*] that could have played a part
in the requirement to avoid them.

I wonder if it would be ethical to use Archive.org for this.

In an ideal world, CRAN would be able to directly archive larger
software packages (just like PyPI is currently hosting more than a
terabyte of Tensorflow builds and a few terabytes more of other
GPU-related code [**]) without requiring the maintainers to swim
between the Scylla of vendoring the dependencies and the Charybdis of
making the build depend on an external URL, but that's a luxury someone
would have to pay for.

Software Heritage (see [1] for their website and [2] for a brief intro I gave
at useR! 2019 in Toulouse) covers GitHub and CRAN [3]. It is by now 'in
collaboration with UNESCO', supported by a long and posh list of sponsors [4]
and about as good as it gets to 'ensure longevity of artifacts'.

It is of course not meant for downloads during frequent builds.

But given the 'quasi-institutional nature' and sponsorship, we could think of
using GitHub as an 'active cache'. But CRAN is CRAN and as it now stands
GitHub is not trusted.  ?\_(?)_/?

I'd happily give up my Netflix subscription for this. I suspect the
R-foundation/consortium could assist as well?

Referring to the "Using Rust in CRAN packages" document we must be able to

...download a specific version from a secure and reliable site


but, as far as I can tell, there is no definition of "secure" or "reliable"
or examples of these.
Is there a specification of availability / uptime for the site? Or
otherwise.

*What venues do we have for working on this issue in a formal manner?*

I think that these small issues add up and really do hamper the ability for
R to grow as a language.
Talented developers (that adjective does not apply to myself) spend *a lot* of
time trying to resolve
these issues. And too many (one is too many) have given up on CRAN and
consequently their
contributions to R have dwindled.

There are a number of really great tools that have to handle this
independently (arrow R packages and DuckDB
are good examples) but they have teams and funding behind them. If the bar
is going to be so high to publish
a package, we need to at least make a ladder (tools, packages, templates
etc) to get there.

FWIW serialize() is binary so there is no conversion to text:

> serialize(1:10+0L, NULL)
 [1] 58 0a 00 00 00 03 00 04 02 00 00 03 05 00 00 00 00 05 55 54 46 2d 38 00 00
[26] 00 0d 00 00 00 0a 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 02 00 00 00 03 00 00 00 04 00 00 00
[51] 05 00 00 00 06 00 00 00 07 00 00 00 08 00 00 00 09 00 00 00 0a

It uses the native representation so it is actually not as bad as it sounds.

One aspect I forgot to mention in the earlier thread is that if you don't need to exchange the serialized objects between machines with different endianness then avoiding the swap makes it faster. E.g, on Intel (which is little-endian and thus needs swapping):

> a=1:1e8/2
> system.time(serialize(a, NULL))
   user  system elapsed 
  2.123   0.468   2.661 
> system.time(serialize(a, NULL, xdr=FALSE))
   user  system elapsed 
  0.393   0.348   0.742

Would it be worth looking into making xdr=FALSE the default? From
help("serialize"):

xdr: a logical: if a binary representation is used, should a
big-endian one (XDR) be used?
...
As almost all systems in current use are little-endian, xdr = FALSE
can be used to avoid byte-shuffling at both ends when transferring
data from one little-endian machine to another (or between processes
on the same machine). Depending on the system, this can speed up
serialization and unserialization by a factor of up to 3x.

This seems like a low-hanging fruit that could spare the world from
wasting unnecessary CPU cycles.

I thought about it before, but the main problem here is (as often) compatibility. The current default guarantees that the output can be safely read on any machine while xdr=FALSE only works if used on machines with the same endianness and will fail horribly otherwise. R cannot really know whether the user intends to transport the serialized data to another machine or not, so it cannot assume it is safe unless the user indicates so. Therefore all we can safely do is tell the users that they should use it where appropriate -- and the documentation explicitly says so:

     As almost all systems in current use are little-endian, ?xdr =
     FALSE? can be used to avoid byte-shuffling at both ends when
     transferring data from one little-endian machine to another (or
     between processes on the same machine).  Depending on the system,
     this can speed up serialization and unserialization by a factor of
     up to 3x.

Unfortunately, no one bothers to reads the documentation so it is not as effective as changing the default, but for reasons above it is just not as easy to change. I do acknowledge that the risk is relatively low since big-endian machines are becoming rare, but it's not zero.

That said, what worries me a bit more is that some derived functions such as saveRDS() don't expose the xdr option, so you actually have no way to use the native binary format. I understand the logic - see above, but as you said, that makes them unnecessarily slow. I wonder if it may be worth doing something a bit smarter and tag officially a "reverse XDR" format instead - that way it would be well-defined and could be made the default. Interestingly, the de-serialization part actually doesn't care, so you can use readRDS() on the binary serialization even in current R versions, so just adding the option would still be backwards-compatible. Definitely something to think about...

Simon

Dear Ivan,


Thanks again for the help, you've given me some great pointers to 
pursue. I will keep you posted on what CRAN responds and whether I find 
a workaround.

The problem is not the quality of the compiler so much as the fact that 
it's not finished. They don't make a big secret of the fact that it's 
still under development. It may be the standard in industry as you say, 
but it would greatly surprise me if it was the default for most ordinary 
users. Most distros and platforms seem to ship the (much more complete) 
gfortran.


Yours,

Do you mean changing R so that when reading a "B\n" serialized stream,
a format code read as 0x02000000 or 0x03000000 would mean regular
formats 2 or 3 but byte-swapped? That would be backwards-compatible,
and we probably weren't going to have >= 65536 format versions anyway...

Dear friends,

I am developing an R package built with Rcpp. The package passed the test
with devtools::check() before submission to CRAN, but failed with the
following clang-UBSAN issue after submission to CRAN:

/data/gannet/ripley/R/test-clang/Rcpp/include/Rcpp/internal/caster.h:30:25:
runtime error: nan is outside the range of representable values of type
'int'

Is there any way to reproduce the error before submitting the package to
CRAN?

Thank you very much for helping!

Kaifeng

Sharon,

I have upgraded Bioc on the R-oldrel build machines and that seems to have taken care of the problem as far as I can tell:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_HybridMicrobiomes.html

If you have reports like that, it's a better idea to ask us first and always supply the name of the package, otherwise the thread can quickly degrade to wild guesswork and misleading or incorrect answers from unrelated parties.

Cheers,
Simon

On line 4618 of src/misc.cpp of the lrstat package, you have a
suspicious default parameter value:

>> const int n = NA_REAL

NA_REAL is a special kind of NaN, and C++ signed integers cannot
represent NaNs. You probably meant NA_INTEGER.

I think that Rcpp::traits::input_parameter<const int> takes care of
asking R to cast NA_REAL to NA_INTEGER, so this shouldn't directly
cause problems, but without a link to the code and the full error
report we have to resort to forbidden OSINT techniques [1], which don't
always work reliably and may attract the wrong kind of attention on the
darknet [2].

> Is there any way to reproduce the error before submitting the package
> to CRAN?

Yes.

If you use containers, try the rocker/r-devel-ubsan-clang [3] image
that should already contain a "sanitized" build of R produced with the
clang compiler.

If that doesn't help, start with a Fedoda 36 installation and follow
the description [4] to install clang and compile R from source with
sanitizers enabled. This procedure is described in more detail in WRE
4.3.4 [5].

If you start having problems using the Docker/podman image or compiling
R from source, don't hesitate to ask further questions.

R CMD build generates the fields "Authors" and "Maintainers" from the
field "Authors at R", so the easiest way forward is to delete Authors: and
Maintainer: from your DESCRIPTION. Next time you run R CMD build, the
DESCRIPTION file inside the resulting *.tar.gz file will contain the
correct fields "Authors" and "Maintainers".

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] CRAN packages dependency on bioconductor packages
Message-ID: <PH0PR10MB5612E8CF3DAE5ADB26034B799BE32@PH0PR10MB5612.namprd10.prod.outlook.com>

Hi everyone,

I recently developed an R package called 'StepReg' and used the Bioconductor R package 'BiocStyle' in my vignettes, as shown below:

output:
  BiocStyle::html_document:
    toc_float: true
  BiocStyle::pdf_document: default

In my DESCRIPTION file, I added 'BiocStyle' to the Suggests field and included a new line 'biocViews:', as follows:

VignetteBuilder: knitr
biocViews:
Suggests:
    knitr,
    testthat,
    BiocStyle,
    kableExtra

You may find all those information here: https://github.com/JunhuiLi1017/StepReg/tree/dev

There were no error messages when checking with 'R CMD check' and on https://win-builder.r-project.org/upload.aspx. However, an error message occurred when I attempted to upload it to CRAN:

* checking re-building of vignette outputs ... ERROR
Error(s) in re-building vignettes:
--- re-building 'StepReg.Rmd' using rmarkdown
Error: processing vignette 'StepReg.Rmd' failed with diagnostics:
there is no package called 'BiocStyle'
--- failed re-building 'StepReg.Rmd'

SUMMARY: processing the following file failed:
   'StepReg.Rmd'

Error: Vignette re-building failed.
Execution halted

For version 1.5.0 (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/StepReg/index.html), I successfully uploaded it to CRAN without including 'biocViews:' in the DESCRIPTION file two months ago. However, I'm encountering difficulties this time. Any insights or suggestions on resolving this issue would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Junhui

Hi Junhui,

There is a separate log for checking if your package works without
suggested packages: in the StepReg results
The noSuggests title leads to:
https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/noSuggests/StepReg.out
Where you can see that it fails if a user don't have BiocStyle installed.
I don't know if it is possible to use a vignette output conditionally with
knitr: In any case it seems that it would be a requirement (Imports, or
Depends).

However, it is best to not use the Bioconductor style for a package in
CRAN.
You could use the *_vignette or *_document format directly (from rmarkdown
if I recall correctly).
You will remove a dependency and avoid this problem entirely.

Best,

Llu?s

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Altrep header, MSVC, and STRUCT_SUBTYPES macro
Message-ID: <a0fc09bbb47d0c3f9aea55aa91247ce7cf74445a.camel@gmail.com>

I'm seeing some issues using R Altrep classes when compiling a package
with the MSVC compiler on windows.

While CRAN doesn't build windows binaries with this compiler, some
packages such as Arrow and LightGBM have had some success in building
their R packages with MSVC outside of CRAN, in order to enable
functionalities that MinGW doesn't support.

Some R headers do not work out-of-the-box with MSVC, but can be made to
work by using alternative declarations of data structures which the
headers provide. For example, defining the macro 'R_LEGACY_RCOMPLEX'
switches to an alternate declaration of R's complex type, which
compiles just fine under msvc, while the regular declaration doesn't
compile.

I am now trying to use Altrep classes in a package. The code compiles
without errors under MSVC, but executing code that involves returning
Altrep objects leads to segfaults and memory corruptions, even though
it works fine under other compilers.

I see the R Altrep header has this section:
#define STRUCT_SUBTYPES
#ifdef STRUCT_SUBTYPES
# define R_SEXP(x) (x).ptr
# define R_SUBTYPE_INIT(x) { x }
  typedef struct { SEXP ptr; } R_altrep_class_t;
#else
# define R_SEXP(x) ((SEXP) (x))
# define R_SUBTYPE_INIT(x) (void *) (x)
  typedef struct R_altcls *R_altrep_class_t;
#endif

Link:
https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/531d0fd05d3bdc0f8a0350e3ecd3e101d315ab59/src/include/R_ext/Altrep.h#L33

If I manually edit the R header to remove the definition of
'STRUCT_SUBTYPES', leading to the second definition of
'R_altrep_class_t' being used, then things work as expected when the
package is compiled with MSVC (no segfaults and no memory corruptions).

Unfortunately, the Altrep header forcibly defines the macro right there
before the #ifdef. I am guessing that the alternative defintion was
offered there in order for users to try it out with problematic
compilers, but it doesn't seem to be configurable like
'R_LEGACY_RCOMPLEX'.

Is there some way that I can get an R package to use the alternative
declaration of 'R_altrep_class_t' when including that header, or
otherwise some other solution for using Altrep classes under MSVC?

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Interpretation of rhub check failures
Message-ID: <c53d21351efb0e6afbaa432514430f33@uniba.it>

Dear all,

I should submit a new version of the package SchoolDataIT 
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SchoolDataIT/index.html> and 
before doing so I need to check it on multiple flavors.

So I have started trying some checks with rhub.
I have loaded the new version of the package on github 
<https://github.com/lcef97/SchoolDataIT>.
It basically fails all checks, even if changes with respect to the 
previous version (the one on CRAN) are minor and should have no impact 
on the *most likely* causes of error, nor do devtools::check() or 
devtools::check_win_devel() return any error (but I cannot rely solely 
on these two checks since I have already experienced how unpredictably 
they behave on different flavors).

What I am wondering about, however, is how to interpret error outputs 
like this 
(https://github.com/lcef97/SchoolDataIT/actions/runs/9092369467/job/24988944819, 
ubuntu-clang) or 
this(https://github.com/lcef97/SchoolDataIT/actions/runs/9092427648/job/24989126404 
atlas). I guess something wrong happens in the functions with 
--run-donttest.

Could somebody please point me a way to interpret  these failures, or 
way to run checks with operating systems different than mine that does 
not involve the passage on github?

Thank you very much in advance
Best regards
Leonardo

Hi Junhui,

There are about 25 packages in CRAN that use BiocStyle, including yours.
It seems that MetaIntegrator is also facing the same error. I have not
looked too deeply into the issue but it seems that you should also
include "rmarkdown" in the Suggests field.

AFAIK, there is no need to include an empty `biocViews:` field in the
DESCRIPTION. CRAN knows about Bioconductor repositories via
setRepositories().

Note. Users should use BiocManager to resolve Bioconductor dependencies
(rather than setRepositories).

Best regards,
Marcel

Hi Llu?s,

Thanks for your input. I believe it is ok to use a vignette output conditionally with knitr. However,  what confuses me is that I was able to successfully upload StepReg version 1.5.0 to CRAN with BiocStyle listed in the Suggests field. It seems that there is some issues with CRAN check.

Best,
Junhui

Hi Junhui,

There is a separate log for checking if your package works without suggested packages: in the StepReg results
The noSuggests title leads to: https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/noSuggests/StepReg.out
Where you can see that it fails if a user don't have BiocStyle installed.
I don't know if it is possible to use a vignette output conditionally with knitr: In any case it seems that it would be a requirement (Imports, or Depends).

However, it is best to not use the Bioconductor style for a package in CRAN.
You could use the *_vignette or *_document format directly (from rmarkdown if I recall correctly).
You will remove a dependency and avoid this problem entirely.

Best,

Llu?s

For version 1.5.0 (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/StepReg/index.html), I successfully uploaded it to CRAN without including 'biocViews:' in the DESCRIPTION file two months ago. However, I'm encountering difficulties this time. Any insights or suggestions on resolving this issue would be greatly appreciated.

Out of curiousity - which functionalities are those ?

One suggestion would be isolate MSVC-specific code in a library and then 
build a package linking to that - this might turn out to be more portable.

thank you

Hi Marcel,

I appreciate your suggestion and clarification. It is worth mentioning that ?rmarkdown? is included in the Import filed, and I apologize for not stating it here. Interestingly,  I was able to successfully upload StepReg version 1.5.0 to CRAN with BiocStyle listed in the Suggests field. However, I encountered this issue this time around. I attempted to address it by adding an empty `biocViews:` field in the DESCRIPTION, but unfortunately, it did not resolve the problem. It seems that there are some issues with CRAN check.

Best,
Junhui

Hi Junhui,

There are about 25 packages in CRAN that use BiocStyle, including yours.
It seems that MetaIntegrator is also facing the same error. I have not
looked too deeply into the issue but it seems that you should also
include "rmarkdown" in the Suggests field.

AFAIK, there is no need to include an empty `biocViews:` field in the
DESCRIPTION. CRAN knows about Bioconductor repositories via
setRepositories().

Note. Users should use BiocManager to resolve Bioconductor dependencies
(rather than setRepositories).

Best regards,
Marcel

and the 6 hours running time means that your build gets stuck while
running the examples, and then cancelled after 6 hours, that's the
time limit for a build.

This might or might not be specific for GitHub Acitions. If you want
to fix it, you'll need to figure out why the examples get stuck. Try
downloading the build artifacts, and see the output of the examples.
You might need to add more output to see what's going on.

Hi,

I hope this message finds you well.

I recently submitted my R package to CRAN, and I received this note from the CRAN teams: "checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE."

When I run R CMD check on my device, I do not encounter any issues, and I am unsure of the specific steps I need to take to resolve this note.

Could you please provide guidance on how to address this note and ensure my package meets CRAN's requirements for submission? Any insights or recommendations you can offer would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you in advance for your assistance.

Best regards,
Zeinab

Yes, I'd consider the package providing the vignette output format for 
the rmarkdown engine, here BiocStyle, as a strong dependency of that 
vignette. The error from the additional "noSuggests" check 
(<https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/noSuggests/README.txt>) shows it 
cannot be rebuild if BiocStyle is unavailable.

The 'StepReg' vignette could use a metadata line to declare strong 
vignette dependencies, for example:

     %\VignetteDepends{StepReg, BiocStyle, kableExtra}

(I haven't checked if this list is complete.)

This avoids spurious check errors in incomplete setups, such as when 
mass-checking packages (e.g., reverse dependencies) without some of the 
suggested packages being installed.

Best,

which it gave you?

Dear Zeinab,

Welcome to R-package-devel!

? Thu, 16 May 2024 03:22:56 +0000
Zeinab Mashreghi <z.mashreghi at uwinnipeg.ca> ?????:

> I recently submitted my R package to CRAN, and I received this note
> from the CRAN teams: "checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE."

Without a link to the full error log and, ideally, to the source code
of the package, it's impossible to help with such a NOTE, because the
check for "CRAN incoming feasibility" encompasses many tests. I was
lucky to fish your package from the archived queue and correlate it
with the publicly available logs, but it's not always this simple:

https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/bootsurv_0.0.0.9000_20240515_212834/

>> New submission

This is expected and will always result in a NOTE to flag the package
to a CRAN reviewer.

>> Version contains large components (0.0.0.9000)

The convention is to use version components like 9000 for pre-release,
untested versions of packages. Could you please use a version like
0.0.1 for the version of the package to be released on CRAN?

> Unknown, possibly misspelled, fields in DESCRIPTION:
>  ?ImportFrom? ?Data?

'importFrom' is a NAMESPACE file directive [1]. The DESCRIPTION must
list 'Imports:' instead [2]. What did you intend to mean with the Data:
field of your DESCRIPTION?

>> The Title field should be in title case. Current version is:
>> ?Bootstrap Methods for complete (absence of missing values) survey
>> data?
>> In title case that is:
>> ?Bootstrap Methods for Complete (Absence of Missing Values) Survey
>> Data?

This is yet another CRAN convention. You'll need to change the 'Title:'
field of the DESCRIPTION file.

>> * checking Rd line widths ... NOTE
>> Rd file 'boot.twostage.Rd':
>>  \examples lines wider than 100 characters:

Could you please wrap the lines of your \examples{} sections to 100
characters or less?

>> * checking examples ... [21m/21m] NOTE
>> Examples with CPU (user + system) or elapsed time > 5s
>>                        user system  elapsed
>> boot.weights.stsrs 1242.735  0.492 1243.285
>> boot.twostage         9.799  0.048    9.847

The \examples{...} in your documentation are not only to be read by the
user. R CMD check runs them periodically on the CRAN servers. The user
should also be able to run example(boot.weights.stsrs) and see your
code directly in action. CRAN requires examples to run in 5 seconds or
less, both elapsed and CPU time. An example(...) that runs for 20
minutes is way too long. You'll need to find a way to reduce the time
spent in the example.

Wasn't something like this said in the e-mail you received from CRAN?

> When I run R CMD check on my device, I do not encounter any issues,

Even with R CMD check --as-cran?

It is documented in WRE as a soft dependency of the package: "As Sweave 
is the only engine supplied with the R distribution, the package 
providing any other engine must be specified in the ?VignetteBuilder? 
field of the package DESCRIPTION file, and also specified in the 
?Suggests?, ?Imports? or ?Depends? field (since its namespace must be 
available to build or check your package)."

I forget now, but presumably the thinking at the time was that Suggested 
packages would always be available for building and checking vignettes.

With most soft dependencies, it's up to the package writer to handle the 
possibility that it is missing, but here, I think it has to be the check 
code that does it, skipping the vignette test if the builder is missing.

Alternatively, it could be required to be a hard dependency, but that 
seems too strong:  most package users don't need to rebuild vignettes.

Indeed, having it listed in Suggests plus the \VignetteDepends 
declaration should suffice.

Yes, re-building vignettes is skipped when a VignetteBuilder package is 
unavailable.

In the present case, the VignetteBuilder package that provides the 
engine is knitr and BiocStyle is used for an alternative rmarkdown 
output format. Not sure if the latter should be declared as an 
additional VignetteBuilder even if it does not provide the vignette 
engine, but you are right that it comes very close.

Agreed. Declaring it as part of the vignette's \VignetteDepends is what 
I'd do to solve the check issue.

Yes. I argued for years (cf https://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/blog/2017/03/22/
from seven (!!) years ago) and CRAN is slowly moving away from that implicit
'always there' guarantee to prefering explicit enumerations -- and now even
tests via the NoSuggests flavour.

As Uwe stated in this thread, having the vignette dependencies both in
Suggests as well as in the VignetteHeader should do. And it is the Right
Thing (TM) to do.

Interesting ABI incompatibility you've found. Can you show a minimal
example? I've tried playing with https://godbolt.org/ and passing
around values of type R_altrep_class_t between functions, but couldn't
convince "x64 msvc v19.latest" to generate different assembly no matter
whether R_altrep_class_t was a pointer or a struct containing a SEXP.

While it's hard to argue with results (I don't think it'll ever be
broken on x86_64 Windows), this workaround relies on undefined
behaviour and will only work as long as the ABI as understood by GCC
passes a structure with a pointer inside exactly the same way as the
ABI as understood by MSVC passes a bare pointer.

Isolating the MSVC-specific code as suggested by Vladimir should be
safer, but it's also important to find out where exactly the
incompatibility arises from. The GCC and MSVC parts still have to use a
common ABI to talk to each other.

Hi,

Thank you very much for your helpful suggestion! Following your advice, I revisited the package and made necessary adjustments to the description file. However, it appears that there are now some issues with HTML validation in the .Rd files. Here's the relevant excerpt, and I've attached the log for further reference.

checking HTML version of manual ... NOTE
Found the following HTML validation problems:
All.data.html:4:1 (All.data.Rd:10): Warning: <link> inserting "type" attribute

Without a link to the full error log and, ideally, to the source code
of the package, it's impossible to help with such a NOTE, because the
check for "CRAN incoming feasibility" encompasses many tests. I was
lucky to fish your package from the archived queue and correlate it
with the publicly available logs, but it's not always this simple:

https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/bootsurv_0.0.0.9000_20240515_212834/

>> New submission

This is expected and will always result in a NOTE to flag the package
to a CRAN reviewer.

>> Version contains large components (0.0.0.9000)

The convention is to use version components like 9000 for pre-release,
untested versions of packages. Could you please use a version like
0.0.1 for the version of the package to be released on CRAN?

Sys.setenv("_R_CHECK_RD_VALIDATE_RD2HTML_" = FALSE)

Hi,


Thank you very much for your helpful suggestion! Following your advice, I revisited the package and made necessary adjustments to the description file. However, it appears that there are now some issues with HTML validation in the .Rd files. Here's the relevant excerpt, and I've attached the log for further reference.

Without a link to the full error log and, ideally, to the source code
of the package, it's impossible to help with such a NOTE, because the
check for "CRAN incoming feasibility" encompasses many tests. I was
lucky to fish your package from the archived queue and correlate it
with the publicly available logs, but it's not always this simple:


https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/bootsurv_0.0.0.9000_20240515_212834/ <https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/bootsurv_0.0.0.9000_20240515_212834/>


>> New submission


This is expected and will always result in a NOTE to flag the package
to a CRAN reviewer.


>> Version contains large components (0.0.0.9000)


The convention is to use version components like 9000 for pre-release,
untested versions of packages. Could you please use a version like
0.0.1 for the version of the package to be released on CRAN?


> Unknown, possibly misspelled, fields in DESCRIPTION:

Are you using an Apple computer? R relies on a program called "tidy" to
verify the generated HTML documentation. macOS comes with an old
version of "tidy" [*] that doesn't support the HTML5 attributes used by
R, which results in these NOTEs. You didn't get them on CRAN, so feel
free to ignore them.

If you run tidy -v or tidy --version, what does it say?

Thanks for the hints.

Unfortunately, after some further testing, it seems this was just a
matter of getting lucky - using the alternative non-STRUCT_SUBTYPES 
def. of Altrep still leads to memory corruptions and crashes, just at
different points than when using the STRUCT_SUBTYPES definition. Sorry
for the trouble.

> Interesting ABI incompatibility you've found. Can you show a minimal

May I ask: how would you go around getting R code into Godbolt? Getting
something like the Altrep definitions and methods would involve a large
amount of R headers joined together before any package code.

> Out of curiousity - which functionalities are those ?

As I understand it (not the author of the package), this is about
integrations with frameworks for GPU computing, and the Altrep code is
used for returning the results of model fitting and serialization
functions, so unfortunately not feasible to move it to a different
package.

> it's also important to find out where exactly the
> incompatibility arises from

I unfortunately haven't been able to isolate the issue, and am not sure
how to. As far as I can tell, the altrep methods are calling the
functions which they were assigned so at least the 'set' and 'dataptr'
methods are working, but memory corruptions that crash the program
happen after calling such altrep methods, particularly when there is a
combination of 'R_UnwindProtect', C++ 'catch' that involves destructing
variables before 'R_ContinueUnwind', and then 'Rf_error'.

Dear all,

I have been asked to fix a UBSAN error in my dqrng package. The error
itself and the necessary fix are quite straight forward. However, I
want to make 100% sure that I am really fixing the error. In the past
I had used rhub for tasks like that. But it seems like the new rhub v2
offers only ASAN testing. I have also tried various docker images
(wch1/r-debug, old rhub images, rocker), but with none of them I was
able to reproduce the error seen on CRAN. What would you consider as
"state of the art" for reproducing UBSAN errors?

Thanks
Ralf

R-hub v2 has UBSAN testing, the clang-asan image also has UBSAN. [1]

With the glitch that UBSAN errors do not fail the build because of a bug [2],
so you'll need to look at the results even if the build has passed.

So much for the hope for an easy solution.

Definitely not much of it. I was assuming that the problem was due to
passing structs by value (something that had been a problem for MSVC
compatibility more than a decade ago on x86 Windows), so I only
provided typedef struct SEXPREC *SEXP, one of the two definitions of
R_altrep_class_t and related macros, declared a number of functions
that would accept or return R_altrep_class_t by value, and tried to
call them.

I don't know a good way to use Godbolt for larger amounts of code.

What do the crashes look like? Is it heap corruption? Stack corruption?
Are they at least deterministic?

Can you reproduce the error by compiling one of the example ALTREP
classes [1] with MSVC, without C++ exception handling? What about using
R_ContinueUnwind() and/or C++ exceptions in some non-ALTREP code
compiled using MSVC?

Maybe if you run the code under Dr. Memory [2] or Application Verifier
[3], it'll detect the corruption slightly earlier and let you pinpoint
the problem? I'm assuming that there is no good way to link a sanitizer
into the process.

Can you eliminate C runtime incompatibility? Is there a chance that a
heap object allocated by the UCRT linked to R is freed by the CRT
linked to the MSVC-side library (or vice versa)?

Hi,

Thanks for all the suggestions and help.

Yes, I'm using an Apple computer. The tidy version was from 2006. I submitted the package without any issues.

Thanks again!

Are you using an Apple computer? R relies on a program called "tidy" to
verify the generated HTML documentation. macOS comes with an old
version of "tidy" [*] that doesn't support the HTML5 attributes used by
R, which results in these NOTEs. You didn't get them on CRAN, so feel
free to ignore them.

If you run tidy -v or tidy --version, what does it say?

this is a suggestion to CRAN.
when checking a package and discovering these messages about html5, can you generate an informational message about tidy with a link to updating tidy?

thank you

I don't think that will ever happen.  It only happens when a user tries 
an "--as-cran" check, but doesn't have a current version of tidy 
installed.  CRAN does have the up-to-date versions installed, so they 
won't see this.

exactly. when the --as-cran detects the need for that NOTE, it could prefix the initial instance of that NOTE with information about
updating the tidy installation on the package writer'smachine.

That's a useful suggestion.

Would you mind testing the patch from
<https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2023-August/082763.html>?

If you or someone else here has a computer running macOS, what exactly
does it print when running `tidy --version` (1) with an old version of
Tidy (that comes with macOS) and (2) with a new (>= 5) version of Tidy?

In answer to the question about tidy version on macOS, I have the latest version of that OS (Sonoma 14.5 release 23F79 -- a beta release, unless the official has caught up in recent days) and I get as follows.  The second one is from the homebrew project, and that's what gets used by default on my machine.  I don't know which of these R would be using, but I could check that if required (and if provided a hint on how to invoke R to tell me).

$  ~ /usr/bin/tidy --version
HTML Tidy for Mac OS X released on 31 October 2006 - Apple Inc. build 9576

$ ~ /usr/local/bin/tidy --version
HTML Tidy for Apple macOS version 5.8.0

Thank you for providing the output! R CMD check only knows about "Apple
Inc. build 2649" (not 9576) being old, which must be why the spurious
NOTEs appeared on Zeinab's computer.

Submitted the updated patch at
<https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18731>.

I would expect Sys.which(Sys.getenv("R_TIDYCMD", "tidy")) to point to
the new version in /usr/local/bin/.

I seem to be later than some other respondents.  But for closure:


The patch you sent produces a msg <- ": 'tidy' is not HTML Tidy"
I would like to have the note tell the user how to update tidy, by giving an explicit
reference to https://www.html-tidy.org/



from the *shell* buffer in emacs

rmh at MacBook-Air-5 ~ % which tidy
/usr/bin/tidy
rmh at MacBook-Air-5 ~ % tidy --version

 with OpenMP
Message-ID: <IA1PR02MB916074AAAA1015936080A95BACEA2@IA1PR02MB9160.namprd02.prod.outlook.com>

Hi all,

I'm running into build issues for my package (fido: https://github.com/jsilve24/fido) on the r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-clang system on CRAN (full check log here: https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/fido_1.1.0_20240515_211644/Debian/00install.out). fido relies on several of the Rcpp packages, and I think the error is due to how OpenMP is set up in our package. The error in question states:

"Error: package or namespace load failed for ?fido? in dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...):
 unable to load shared object '/home/hornik/tmp/R.check/r-devel-clang/Work/build/Packages/00LOCK-fido/00new/fido/libs/fido.so':
  /home/hornik/tmp/R.check/r-devel-clang/Work/build/Packages/00LOCK-fido/00new/fido/libs/fido.so: undefined symbol: omp_get_thread_num"

I've had a hard time recreating the error, as I can successfully get the package to build on other systems (GitHub action results here: https://github.com/jsilve24/fido/actions) including a system using the same version of R/clang as the failing CRAN check. Looking at the logs between the two, the major difference is the lack of -fopenmp in the compiling function on the CRAN version (which is there on the r-hub check version with the same specifications):

(From the CRAN version) clang++-18 -std=gnu++17 -shared -L/home/hornik/tmp/R-d-clang-18/lib -Wl,-O1 -o fido.so ConjugateLinearModel.o MaltipooCollapsed_LGH.o MaltipooCollapsed_Optim.o MatrixAlgebra.o PibbleCollapsed_LGH.o PibbleCollapsed_Optim.o PibbleCollapsed_Uncollapse.o PibbleCollapsed_Uncollapse_sigmaKnown.o RcppExports.o SpecialFunctions.o test_LaplaceApproximation.o test_MultDirichletBoot.o test_utils.o -L/home/hornik/tmp/R-d-clang-18/lib -lR

My initial thought was an issue in the configure scripts (which we borrowed heavily from RcppArmadillo but made slight changes to (which is the most likely cause if there is issue here)) or that there is some mismatch somewhere as to whether or not OpenMP is available, but there isn't an obvious bug to me.

Any guidance on how to debug would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks,
Michelle

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] handling documentation build tools
Message-ID: <BY3PR05MB8116D430AB46C7B5F0A60E7D87EA2@BY3PR05MB8116.namprd05.prod.outlook.com>

I have some documentation that requires external tools to build.  I would like to build the automatically, with requiring either users or repositories to have the tools.  What's the best way to accomplish that.

Specifically one document is written using the LyX word processor, so the "source" is msep.lyx.  To convert that into something useful, a pdf, one must run lyx, which in turn requires latex.

I'm looking for recommendations about how to approach this.

A purely manual approach would be to place msep.lyx in .Rbuildignore and manually regenerate the pdf if I edit the file.

This has 2 drawbacks: first, it does not guarantee that the pdf is consistent with the current source; second, if I want to generate plain text or html versions of the document as well, the manual approach gets more tedious and error prone.

Currently I use pkgbuild::build's option to run bootstrap.R to run the lyx->pdf conversion automatically with each build.  The script is pretty specific to my build environment, and I think if I uploaded the package CRAN would end up trying to run bootstrap.R, which would fail.

Maybe the script should go in tools/? But then it won't run automatically.  Maybe the script in tools goes in .Rbuildignore and the bootstrap.R script simply checks if the tools/ script exists and runs it if present.

Suggestions?

I'm also unsure what directory msep.lyx should go in, though that's a secondary issue.  Currently it's in inst/doc, which led to problems with the build system sometimes wiping it out.  I've solved that problem.

Thanks.
Ross

I seem to recall that that machine is 'known-bad' for OpenMP due to the
reliance on clang-18 which cannot (?) build with it.  Might be best to
contact Kurt Hornik (CC'ed) and/or CRAN.

So I want to build the document only locally, as you suggest, but am not sure how to accomplish that.

Regarding the trick, I'm puzzled by what it gains.  It seems like a complicated way to get the core pdf copied to inst/doc.

Also, my main concern was how to automate production of the "core" pdf, using the language of the blog post.

Ross,

It's entirely up to you how you do this -- what you describe is something that has to happen before your run R CMD build, so it's not reflected in your package that you submit (and this has nothing to do with CRAN or R). There is nothing automatic as it requires you to do something in any case. It's entirely up to you which tools you use before you call R CMD build - it comes down to personal preferences. You have already described all that is needed: the most simple solution is to have either a Makefile or a script in your repository that does whatever you need (Makefile gives you the automatic update for free) and you put those in .Rbuildignore so they will not be part of the package source you submit as the output of R CMD build. Typically, it is customary to keep the sources (here you .lyx) in the distributed package, "tools" is one place you could do it safely, but it is not well-defined.

There is a slight variation on the above: you can (ab)use the "cleanup" script so that the process is actually run by R CMD build itself. E.g., the cleanup script could simply check if your Makefile is present (which would be only in the repo, but not in that tar ball) and simply run make in that case.

That said, as Dirk mentioned, since your output is documentation, the semantically correct way would be to treat it as a vignette, which is well-documented and specifically provides way for what you described and it is clear that it is documentation and not just some random script.

Cheers,
Simon

I usually just create a Makefile.

It can be something like this:


all: documentation.pdf

documentation.pdf: documentation.lyx
 	lyx --export pdf4 documentation.lyx

Then every time before you do R build, must run make in the directory with 
the Makefile.

Interesting.

Kurt, is there a recommended way to test for this (rare, I may add) case of
'OpenMP present but usage verboten by R' ?  I do not see an option for 'R CMD
config' jumping out, and there is no pkg-config file either.

Testing via 'nm' as you show is possible but not exactly 'portable'.  So any
suggestions as to what to condition on here?  Michelle did AFAICT the Right
Thing (TM) by 'borrowing' from the fairly mature check in RcppArmadillo.

Dirk

Not that I know much about writing configure tests, but won't 
src/include/config.h in the R build dir have "HAVE_OPENMP" defined if 
OpenMP is supported?

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] callr and CRAN policy on the max number of cores
Message-ID: <CAPVJd2Uw_9SHVYct0tDAh+H4h9mtWOW7wVSkGw1fONgUKO-hQg@mail.gmail.com>

Hil,

I am exploring the use of callr in a package. I know that for packages
that do parallel computing, we should not use more than two cores in
examples, tests, etc. when being checked on CRAN.

I believe I can use callr in tests and examples. How should I use
callr in compliance with CRAN policy? Because even just one call to
callr will start a new R session, should I limit the use of callr such
that at any one time, only one background R session created by callr
is active?

Regards,
Shu Fai

Two parallel processes are okay, so you can use two callr background
processes ("children"), as long as you don't do heavy computations on
the main R process ("parent"). This is commonly done in many R
packages, e.g.

library(parallel)
cl <- makeCluster(2)
y <- parLapply(cl = cl, X = 1:10, fun = slow_fcn)
stopCluster(cl)

I think what Michelle and I are after is for an _installed_ version of R to
tell us if we can, or cannot, use OpenMP.  Maybe capabilities() needs and extension?

Right, sorry.  I thought that file was distributed, but it's Rconfig.h 
that gets installed, and it only has a subset of the definitions.

(My apologies if you already got an answer from Kurt. I think we're not
seeing his mails to the list.)

Perhaps take the configure test a bit further and try to dyn.load() the
resulting shared object? To be extra sure, call the function that uses
the OpenMP features? (Some weird systems may have lazy binding enabled,
making dyn.load() succeed but crashing the process on invocation of a
missing function.)

On GNU/Linux, the linker will happily leave undefined symbols in when
creating a shared library (unlike on, say, Windows, where extern void
foo(void); foo(); is a link-time error unless an object file or an
import library providing foo() is also present). When loading such a
library, the operation fails unless the missing symbols are already
present in the address space of the process (e.g. from a different
shared library).

A fresh process of R built without OpenMP support will neither link in
the OpenMP runtime while running SHLIB nor have the OpenMP runtime
loaded and so should successfully fail the test.

I also wouldn't call the entry point "main" just in case some future
compiler considers this a violation of the rules? [*] and breaks the
code. extern "C" void configtest(int*) would be compatible with .C()
without having to talk to R's memory manager:

# The configure script:
cat > test-omp.cpp <<EOF
#include <omp.h>
extern "C" void configtest(int * arg) {
  *arg = omp_get_num_threads();
}
EOF
# Without the following you're relying on the GNU/Linux-like behaviour
# w.r.t. undefined symbols (see WRE 1.2.1.1):
cat > Makevars <<EOF
PKG_CXXFLAGS = \$(SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS)
PKG_LIBS = \$(SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS)
EOF
R CMD SHLIB test-omp.cpp

# And then in R:
dyn.load(paste0("test-omp", .Platform$dynlib.ext))
# There's probably no need to test the return value, right?
.C("configtest", arg = integer(1))$arg

Given that comes from RcppArmadillo we can rely on Rcpp::cppFunction() or
Rcpp::sourceCpp() which should make that dance a little simpler.

I had forgotten this was in fact a home-grown shell snippet (per `git blame`
last polished by Kevin, now CC'ed, in 2020).  That should make an explicit
load -- and noticing when we fail to load -- feasible.

Maybe someone has time and appetite for contributing a PR?

Cheers, Dirk

Kurt,

Could you do me a favour and run on that clang18-using machine in question
the following one-liner (provided your session has access to a .libPaths()
including Rcpp) and, in the case of success, the resulting function?

  > Rcpp::cppFunction("int ompconfigtest() { return omp_get_num_threads(); }", includes="#include <omp.h>", plugin="openmp")
  > ompconfigtest()
  [1] 1
  > 

On a "normal" development machine such as mine here it works.

Presumably it will fail at your end because -fopenmp will not be / cannot be
substituted in from the openmp plugin defined by Rcpp:

  ## built-in OpenMP plugin
  .plugins[["openmp"]] <- function() {
      list(env = list(PKG_CXXFLAGS="-fopenmp",
                      PKG_LIBS="-fopenmp"))
  }

but it would be nice to know if that does indeed fail.

Thanks,  Dirk

That seems a very nice way of following WRE's 

  If you do use your own checks, make sure that OpenMP support is
  complete by compiling and linking an OpenMP-using program

Modulo not hard-wiring 'R' in the configure code, and instead doing the
usual

  : ${R_HOME=`R RHOME`}
  if test -z "${R_HOME}"; then
    echo "could not determine R_HOME"
    exit 1
  fi
  
  "${R_HOME}/bin/R" CMD SHLIB .....

etc.

Dear List -

I received a note that my package -- epanet2toolkit -- was showing a
warning in the fedora-gcc results on CRAN.
https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/gcc12/epanet2toolkit.out

I'd like to reproduce the warning and fix it.  Usually I'd do that with
Docker.  Is anyone aware of a docker image or dockerfile with this setup?

Thanks,

Fedora 40 comes with gcc 14.1.x. But I would first try to use the
`-Wformat-truncation=` flag with the compiler you have, it is possible
that you don't need gcc 14.1. If you do, then the `fedora:40`
container should be good.

By habit I usually try to see if what I need is already in Debian unstable
(or experimental if I must). So I just fired up 'docker run --rm -ti
rocker/r-base bash' and that one (which I stand behind) does have
gcc-14. Twice, infact, as 14.1.0 in unstable and 14-20240330 in testing.

There are also some efforts to provide containers of the (generally not
"exported") setup(s) at CRAN which may by now have this.  The last time I
looked for it it either wasn't quite there yet or fell short for another
reason.

Good luck,  Dirk

I can: 

R> Rcpp::cppFunction("int ompconfigtest() { return omp_get_num_threads(); }", includes="#include <omp.h>", plugin="openmp")
Warning in Rcpp::cppFunction("int ompconfigtest() { return omp_get_num_threads(); }",  :
  partial argument match of 'plugin' to 'plugins'
R>  ompconfigtest()
[1] 1

The system has OpenMP, but R was configured not to use it.

In general, packages should leave the decision to use OpenMP to the
*user*, who can use their own Makevars files to override the R system
Makevars SHLIB_OPENMP_* settings as desired.

Hmpf.

Didn't help here, did it?  Or maybe Rcpp was too eager with 

   .plugins[["openmp"]] <- function() {
       list(env = list(PKG_CXXFLAGS="-fopenmp",
                       PKG_LIBS="-fopenmp"))
   }

and we'd need something like this (untested)

   .plugins[["openmp"]] <- function() {
       list(env = list(PKG_CXXFLAGS=Sys.getenv("SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS, ""),
                       PKG_LIBS=Sys.getenv("SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS, "")))
   }

Actually, does not work it does come into the R session. Only goes to `make`.

So I got nothing. Sorry.

Dirk

Thanks G?bor and Dirk for the suggestions. This one seemed to need fedora
to replicate the issue.  Docker did make it easy:

FROM fedora:40
USER root
RUN dnf -y install R

From the documentation, it sounds like a good use for

# variables will be pre-loaded from Makeconf
Rcpp.plugin.maker(Makevars = '
 PKG_CXXFLAGS = $(SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS)
 PKG_LIBS = $(SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS)
')

...but I can't figure out where out$Makevars is used in Rcpp.

This could also be a use for R CMD config, but SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS is
not currently on the list of variables to query:

# Makes use of implementation details, ignores user settings
make \
 R_HOME=/usr/lib/R R_SHARE_DIR=/usr/share/R/share \
 -f /usr/lib/R/etc/Makeconf -f /usr/share/R/share/make/config.mk \
 print VAR=SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS
# => -fopenmp

R CMD config SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS
# => ERROR: no information for variable 'SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS'

Looking at RcppArmadillo:::inlineCxxPlugin itself, it seems that
there's no escaping, so Make expressions can be used directly inside
the environment variables:

registerPlugin('openmp', function() list(env = list(
 PKG_LIBS = '$(SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS)',
 PKG_CPPFLAGS = '$(SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS)'
)))

This is mandated by POSIX ("All other environment variables, including
those with null values, shall be used as macros") and seems to work in
OpenBSD make too.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Debian and Fedora clang segmentation faults
Message-ID: <d1326754-d4d1-4b9e-9525-f68cedfcfb66@wisc.edu>

Hello everyone,

I'm updating the 'astrochron' R package, and I'm trying to resolve a new segmentation fault that arises only with the Debian and Fedora clang compilers. An example is the function 'asm', which has been a component of astrochron since its debut July 2014:

https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_astrochron.html

I'm developing this on a Intel Mac, and trying to track down the specific issue, without success yet.

The relevant source is in /src/asm1.8cR.f

Many thanks for any advice you can provide!

All the best,

  ?Stephen Meyers

This one is reproducible using containers or a virtual machine. Indeed,

flang-new-18 decided to subtract 400 megabytes from the stack pointer
right from the start, and never mind the fact that operating systems
treat the stack space like hundred-year-old brandy and the total stack
size limit is only 8 megabytes or so.

I think that the 400.8 megabytes come from the saveAsm(mxsr,mxdata)
array, which is mxsr=500 * mxdata=100000 * 8 bytes per real(8) in size,
and store(mxdata), which takes additional 800 kilobytes. When compiling
with warnings enabled, GFortran even produces a message about it:

>> Warning: Array ?saveasm? at (1) is larger than limit set by
>> ?-fmax-stack-var-size=?, moved from stack to static storage. This
>> makes the procedure unsafe when called recursively, or concurrently
>> from multiple threads. Consider increasing the

>> ALLOCATABLE array. If the variable is never accessed concurrently,
>> this warning can be ignored, and the variable could also be declared
>> with the SAVE attribute. [-Wsurprising]

The Fortran standard is silent about the stack vs heap vs static
storage issue, so flang-new is technically allowed to try to fit 400
megabytes of temporary storage on the stack [*].

Since asm18_R doesn't seem to be supposed to be reentrant, the fix is
to give the SAVE attribute to the two large variables, making the
Fortran processors prefer a different memory location for them:

implicit real(8) (a-h,o-z)
save saveAsm, store

(Untested because I accidentally deleted the container while preparing
the message.)

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Flex missing in win-builder
Message-ID: <df0af092a596a804e24b20e5ce2c17f3@nilly.addy.io>

Is it possible to get flex in the win-builder windows environment? It's present in the debian environment. My package depends on cmake, bison, and flex. Each of these are listed in the `SystemRequirments` field of my DESCRIPTION file but flex is the only one that cmake can't find.

The win-builder home page (https://win-builder.r-project.org/) doesn't say much about foreign dependencies other than we have what's available in Rtools plus a small list of others. But neither cmake or bison are available by default in Rtools, they both have to be explicitly installed with `pacman`. Flex can also be installed via `pacman`, so why are the other two available?

I can't find much on how the `SystemRequirments` is used in "Writing R Extensions" either, is this used to tell CRAN what is needed to build the package? Or is it just a hint to end users? If the former how are they supposed to be named? Different package managers have different names for the same packages. Does it need to be named `libfl-dev`? (This Rstudio repo: https://github.com/rstudio/r-system-requirements, makes it look like it's just a hint for humans.)

If not able to access flex, I think I can generate the files locally and commit those but I'm pretty sure that will require doing what `rigraph` had to do and get `Make` compile all the external code that is currently handled by various `CMakeLists.txt` which is probably doable but looks like a lot work and requires manually regenerating and commiting flex files whenever updating external dependencies. Any better alternatives?

Please see CRAN repository policy and contacts included there:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/external_libs.html

But if possible I would include the generated parsers in the source code 
of your package. This is also how R itself does it.

cmake is part of Rtools, please see

Message-ID: <BY3PR05MB8116896F80ED196594F07BFA87F12@BY3PR05MB8116.namprd05.prod.outlook.com>

There are at  least 4 ways to build a package:

  1.  R CMD build
  2.  pkgbuild::build(), which I  believe calls 1.
  3.  devtools::build(), which calls 2.
  4.  RStudio GUI, which calls 3.

I recently discovered these don't all behave the same.  Invoking bootstrap.R at  the start
requires 2 or greater.  And invoking 3 directly produced different behavior than 4,
apparently because of  different defaults for the clean_doc option of 2.

Similar remarks apply to R CMD check.

I'm puzzled by the plethora of tools and options.  In particular I had assumed that if check
and build worked in RStudio, I'd get the same results from R CMD.  I assume the latter is
used on CRAN, and so it would be reasonable to expect the package would build there.

Can anyone help me understand what's going on?  More specifically, what are the design
goals of the different tools.  Clearly if devtools::build were the same as pkgbuild:build there
would be no reason for the former to exist.

Thanks.
Ross

What is bootstrap.R?

pkgbuild, devtools and RStudio are all products of Posit, so it would 
make sense to ask your question in one of their forums.

By the way, RStudio has project and global options that affect its 
builds; the default uses devtools, but I generally deselect that, and go 
straight to 1.

Ross,

R CMD build is the only offical way to build a (source) package in R.

All other "tools" are just convenience wrappers by 3rd parties that call R CMD build eventually. There is no reason to assume that those tools should behave in a certain way - nor are you required to use them. They typically do other pre-processing which their authors deemed useful (typically based on yet another packages). Finally, RStudio is a 3rd party GUI by the company Posit Software, PBC which changes/augments the behaviour of R and provides additional tools - it is not R nor directly related to R (nor CRAN). The packages you mentioned are also maintained by Posit.

Please note that CRAN has nothing to do with any of the above - a package submitted to CRAN is the resulting package source tar ball which the author created by calling R CMD build - CRAN is not involved in the source package creation, it only requires it to be created with R CMD build for submission. Whether you desire some pre-processing, before you call R CMD build yourself, it's up to you.

What is bootstrap.R?


Duncan Murdoch
----------------------------------

Response:

It's a script one can enable to run at the start of the build.  There is no  standard script; it is up to the author(s) to provide it.

The devtools::build help says there is a configuration option in DESCRIPTION:

Config/build/bootstrap can be set to TRUE to run ?Rscript bootstrap.R? in the source directory prior to running subsequent build steps.

I'm using it to build some custom documentation.  Furthermore, I put boostrap.R in .Rbuildignore so that package consumers won't try to run software that they may not have.

In other words, I'm using it to do some special master-copy-only processing, though I doubt that was the intent of the feature.

Ross

P.S. Another difference between the RStudio build and R CMD build is that RStudio adds directories to PATH with the additional software it supplies, like pango, which builds require.  Plain R CMD build did not have access to them and failed for that reason until I added them to PATH.  Alternately I could have done a separate installation of the necessary tools, but that seemed a wasteful complication.

Duncan's point about options is key... the build options set by default in devtools etc are generally configured to minimize the time required to identify the next big issue to address. Options appropriate for preparing to submit to CRAN are slow and inconvenient for developing.

I recommend that you always use option 1 when preparing to share or submit your package.

Note that while using support tools like roxygen, devtools, and RStudio are common, they are intended to streamline the package development process by filling in a lot of busywork details. However, they do not represent the official R-supported development process, and may become out-of-date during R version transitions.

Ross,

R CMD build is the only offical way to build a (source) package in R.

All other "tools" are just convenience wrappers [....]

Please note that CRAN has nothing to do with any of the above - a package submitted to CRAN is the resulting package source tar ball which the author created by calling R CMD build - CRAN is not involved in the source package creation, it only requires it to be created with R CMD build for submission. Whether you desire some pre-processing, before you call R CMD build yourself, it's up to you.

Cheers,
Simon
---------------------------------------

Is it required that the package submitted to CRAN have been built with R CMD build rather than some other tool?  When you say "CRAN has nothing to do with any of the above [different tools]" it sounds as if one can use anything; but "a package submitted to CRAN is ... created by calling R CMD build"  sounds as if  that's mandatory.

Yes, it is - from the CRAN policy:


 Uploads must be source tarballs created by R CMD build and
 following the PACKAGE_VERSION.tar.gz naming scheme.
 This should be done with current R-patched or the current release of R.


But as explained in the previous email the Posit tools you mentioned are simply front-ends which do some stuff and then call R CMD build at the end, so they still fit the bill.

Simon

Message-ID: <CA+T1pOdtf803JVgHCvqLVTa4mXbeS+gcWRhDoz4b8vHYGnaagw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everybody. I'm having a problem submitting a package to CRAN. It
involves a NOTE about  detritus files on the temporary directory.

The thing is my package basically downloads a zip file to the temporary
directory, unzips, reads and processes some of the extracted files and
imports the data to the R environment. So after the examples and tests are
run the temporary directory is full of those files. So I implemented an
internal cleanup function that removes the download zip file and the
directory to which the files are extracted and, of course, the NOTE
disappears. But I really don't like this approach because I want the
function to keep the files in the temporary directory so that if a file has
been already downloaded it would not download the file again and just read
the data.

I thought that R cleaned up the temporary directory when the session ended.
So why is this a problem? Is it that there are too many files aftes
examples and tests are run? or would this NOTE be an issue to CRAN even if
only one file was detected at the end?

Thanks in advance.

This is the NOTE on the logs:

Dear Hector,

The tmp dir depends on the R session. Use tools::R_user_dir("your_package",
which = "cache") if you want a permanent cache of the files.

This problem has two sides.

The side that R CMD check is giving you NOTEs about is that _examples
and tests_ are requried to keep the global state of the system intact.
This includes all files on the computer: writing anywhere except the
tempdir() is prohibited, and even that must be done with care not to
overwrite anything and cleaned up afterwards.

(See https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html and search
for "temporary directory".)

The side that's more subjective is that outside tests and examples,
code shouldn't be touching the filesystem without the user's
permission. Many functions (e.g. write.table()) have a legitimate need
to alter the filesystem. If the user would legitimately benefit from not
having to download the files again (including between R sessions), feel
free to follow the advice of Thierry Onkelinx and use
tools::R_user_dir(...), except in tests and examples.

Testing functions that access external resources over the Internet is
fraught with additional peril. Your examples and tests must not fail if
a download attempt fails, but your users will probably prefer your
functions to stop() with an exception on download failure. One way to
solve this problem is to make sure that the functions that fetch
anything from the Internet raise errors with a specific class set and
then to wrap all examples and tests in tryCatch(...,
yourpackage_Internet_error = function(e) message('Caught an error while
accessing an Internet resource: ', conditionMessage(e))). This way any
other unchecked errors (that your tests attempt to uncover) will still
surface.

Only some parts of the global state:  examples can create variables in 
globalenv().

Hi all,

First off, I want to thank you all for your help! In case it's useful, I was able to solve my issue by using Ivan's suggestion from May 23rd.

Best,
Michelle

Right, sorry.  I thought that file was distributed, but it's Rconfig.h
that gets installed, and it only has a subset of the definitions.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Including "Rmath.h" in C code for an R package
Message-ID: <CAKyzev0G+X4_htpLo1yZPDqtJz6hU-CbK=jREW=PS4GVthCxwQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm extending an R package that uses the R C API directly. I'd like to use
some distribution functions, so I included the "Rmath.h" header. The issue
is that this introduces macros that have unintended consequences for the
code. For example, I have a local variable named "beta", which is expanded
to "Rf_beta".

Is there a way of including the "Rmath.h" header without applying the
macros to my code? E.g. if I want to use the beta function, I would use it
with "Rf_beta(a,b)", but "beta" would remain my local variable.

Thanks for your time!

Best,
Greg

To avoid the remapping of beta to Rf_beta, you should
define R_NO_REMAP_RMATH before you include Rmath:

#define R_NO_REMAP_RMATH
#include <Rmath.h>

... and then remember to include the "Rf_" prefix on the routines that

Thank you for the suggestion! It looks like that caused problems with other
parts of the code, so I just added these couple of lines after the import
to avoid the beta remaps:

#ifdef beta
#undef beta
#endif

Hello once again,


Unfortunately, I didn't receive a reply to the mail I sent CRAN nor the 
follow-up/reminder I sent on 2024-05-09. It's been nearly a month now. I 
understand they're busy of course, but it's a bit disheartening not to 
know what one can do to remedy the situation after putting in so much 
work to try to get it published. Would you (or anyone else) have some 
pointers as to how I can receive a reply from CRAN?


Yours,


Othman El Hammouchi

Othman,

I'm not sure why you would expect a response from CRAN. The ball is in your court - you have to either fix your code (ideally) or provide a justification why you think it is safe. I have not seen any email from you to cran at R-project.org and you have not mentioned the name of the package in this thread (you should really post the link to the sources if you are at all serious about this) so it's hard to follow up on - thus I wouldn't expect anything more on this thread until you make the move.

Cheers,
Simon

Hello Simon,

I must be misunderstanding something, am I expected to CC the mailing 
list when replying to CRAN? I was just trying to follow the instructions 
in the email which states

 > If you are fairly certain the rejection is a false positive, please 
reply-all to this message and explain.

The email address I replied-all to was CRAN-submissions at R-project.org. 
My package is called trngl, the source can be found on GitHub 
(https://github.com/oelhammouchi/trngl). In my reply, I explained that 
flang lacks some very basic features of the Fortran 2003 standard 
(because the compiler is still in development), and that I have added a 
check to abort the installation if the user's compiler doesn't support 
these features. This seemed to me to be coherent with the approach taken 
by packages such as av that require system libraries before they can be 
installed.

I am happy to provide any further detail you want.

Yours,

Othman El Hammmouchi

I have not seen any email from you to cran at R-project.org and you have not mentioned the name of the package in this thread (you should really post the link to the sources if you are at all serious about this) so it's hard to follow up on - thus I wouldn't expect anything more on this thread until you make the move.

Message-ID: <MEYPR01MB7460B73CB97D06D42434BFE9CAF92@MEYPR01MB7460.ausprd01.prod.outlook.com>

(1) Today, I submitted my R package to CRAN using
devtools::submit_cran()
which  resulted in an  email from
CRAN Package Submission Form cransubmit at xmbombadil.wu.ac.at<mailto:cransubmit at xmbombadil.wu.ac.at>
with a confirmation link,  which I clicked on.

(2) I was then sent an email from
ligges at statistik.tu-dortmund.de<mailto:ligges at statistik.tu-dortmund.de>
which notified that my package "does not pass the incoming checks automatically",
with 0 errors, 0 warnings and 2 notes.


(3) I then fixed the problem for one of the notes and explained the reason for the
other note and put this information into the file
cran-comments.md
Then I resubmitted my R package to CRAN using
devtools::submit_cran()

However, this time I did not receive an email with a confirmation link.

Has my package been resubmitted or do I need to resubmit it in some different way?

No, if you didn't get the confirmation link, then you haven't submitted 
it.  You can use `foghorn::cran_incoming()` to see what's in the CRAN 
incoming queue.

When I resubmitted, I didn't realise that I needed to change the version number.

I changed the version number of my package from 1.2.0 to 1.2.1 and the resubmission worked fine.

Message-ID: <d5cc8cb44bcc0f6762d6c9b9bec55381aa6a6c0d.camel@math.aau.dk>

Dear all,

From CRAN maintainers I recieve:


Flavor: r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-gcc
Check: whether package can be installed, Result: WARNING
  Found the following significant warnings:
    grips_fit_ips.cpp:149:45: warning: explicitly assigning value of variable of type 'int' to itself [-Wself-assign]
    grips_fit_ips.cpp:213:16: warning: explicitly assigning value of variable of type 'int' to itself [-Wself-assign]
    grips_fit_ips.cpp:254:10: warning: explicitly assigning value of variable of type 'int' to itself [-Wself-assign]
    grips_fit_ips.cpp:254:21: warning: explicitly assigning value of variable of type 'double' to itself [-Wself-assign]
 


The first warning pertains to the line:

    conips_inner_(S, K, elst0, clist0, print=print);

print on lhs of "=" is the formal name and print on rhs of "=" the name of a variable. Does the compiler think I assign an integer
to itself? Like if I write

int a=7;
a=a;

Can anyone help me throw light on this?

Thanks in advance
S?ren

Unless I'm misunderstanding, you're trying to pass a value by name to a
function. That is not a thing in C nor C++. However if you want to name the
arguments, you can do so with comments:

/* print = */ print

print on lhs of "=" is the formal name and print on rhs of "=" the name of a variable. Does the compiler think I assign an integer

Can anyone help me throw light on this?

I would recommend against using comments in this fashion because while it 
tells you what you meant to do, the compiler does not know it. If you made 
an error the comment will make it harder to find.

If you happen to have a function with a lot of arguments of similar types 
and putting arguments in order is a concern, you can instead convert them 
to a struct and pass a struct instead:

typedef struct {
          int a;
          int b;
          } INPUT_TYPE1

void myfunc(INPUT_TYPE1 x);

And somewhere:
{
INPUT_TYPE1 x;

x.a=3;
x.b=4;

myfunc(x);
}

I don't know whether the modern compilers are smart enough to optimize 
this in the same way as passing an argument list. If this is a concern, 
probably some code restructuring is a good idea.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Check errors for RMarkdown vignettes with error chunks
Message-ID: <CAHfK2MsCoQ-n=-qwfWWmd7R4wBo81vy5AUN1HV+JqqkbHakXjg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

RMarkdown vignettes are sometimes used to demonstrate errors and one
can write vignettes with `error` chunks.

```{r, error = TRUE}
stop()
```

This was not an issue for a long time. But I've experienced sometimes
in the past that packages with these vignettes going through `R CMD
check` gave ERRORS due to these `error` chunks. But recently, I do not
experience the same ERRORS with R 4.4.0.

MacPorts maintainer Sergey Fedorov also reported these ERRORs to the
developers of rio (i.e. I) and tibbles with his darwin-powerpc setup
with the current release, R 4.4.0, on Mac OS X 10.6.

https://github.com/gesistsa/rio/issues/424

https://github.com/tidyverse/tibble/issues/1575

One can easily attribute this to his a-little-bit-archaic setup. But
now CRAN also reports the same ERRORS for mac and linux `oldrel`
(4.3.3).

https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_rio.html

I was wondering if you have any experience with these errors. A
relevant point in the release notes of 4.4.0 is perhaps this:

> tools::testInstalledPackage() is no longer silent about failures from running examples or tests and its return code no longer ignores failures from checking vignettes.

Chung-hong Chan

Message-ID: <CAANT7+VikHZJ9QuRa_AbJk8+K918ZOnh+XaSzCHWSYNmAZcXZw@mail.gmail.com>

https://bioconductor.org/checkResults/3.20/bioc-LATEST/velociraptor/nebbiolo2-buildsrc.html

shows an error arising in R CMD build that cannot be reproduced
in manual attempts with the vignette code that is triggering the
error.  "It works fine except in CMD build" (on linux).

I have tried debugging tools::buildVignettes by setting a debug
call in .Rprofile but it won't step through during R CMD build.  I want
to find out how CMD build manipulates environment to inhibit
resolution of symbols that can be resolved during ordinary interactive
use.

I haven't dug hard into the buildVignettes function.  Before doing so,
I wanted to know if anyone has a way of stepping through in a CMD
build task.

It sounds like R Markdown, when tangling a vignette into an *.R file,
should provide additional wrapping for chunks with the error = TRUE
option set. Would a try({ chunk content }) suffice?

R CMD check relies on the tangled script not to crash, and there is
currently no such wrapping in the generated output:

On Linux, R CMD build launches file.path(R.home('bin'), 'build'), which
is a short script. It should be possible to step into R CMD build by
doing the same thing in an interactive R session:

R_DEFAULT_PACKAGES= LC_COLLATE=C R --no-restore
# set hooks as needed
debug(system)
debug(system2)
# run CMD build
tools:::.build_packages(args = 'package/source/directory')

As this comes up every now and then: This is still a _soft_ requirement. CRAN
does not 'cache' what versions you used in uploads. I have often reiterated
with the same number.

And small add if you like the command-line (in a responsive way) better than
a browser, package `ciw` on CRAN and the example script ciw.r (in `littler`,
only at github yet) make 'spying' at incoming quite easy and
convenient. Right now and showing the default view as well as some options:

Calling `ciw::ciw()` from your R prompt of course also works (if that is your jam).

Hi Ivan,

In my experience, if you add purl=FALSE to those chunks, it will pass the
checks. This was the default but changed/ is the default on some platforms
not others when you have error=TRUE (don't recall details).

Hi,


I am hoping someone has a solution to my befuddling situation.  I am trying
to push an update of a package that has been on CRAN for over a decade.

I am running into a perplexing issue that creates an error in the Windows
build when I submit the package to CRAN.  The error does not occur on:
win-builder-devel,
Debian on CRAN, my mac, or in Docker using r-base on my mac.  Here is the
reported error and the lines above and below in the 00check.log from CRAN
(under windows):


...

* checking package vignettes ... OK
* checking re-building of vignette outputs ... [13s] ERROR
Error(s) in re-building vignettes:
--- re-building 'wnominate.Rnw' using Sweave


* checking PDF version of manual ... [21s] OK
...


In other environments, I get


...

* checking package vignettes ... OK
* checking re-building of vignette outputs ... [6s/6s] OK
* checking PDF version of manual ... [3s/3s] OK

...


The complete logs (that otherwise appear ok to me) are linked below
(though, of course, they will disappear in a few days):

https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/wnominate_1.5_20240607_192611/Windows/00check.log
https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/wnominate_1.5_20240607_192611/Debian/00check.log
https://win-builder.r-project.org/6518MsBoQpPl/00check.log


I know that there is something going on with the vignette (which is, FWIW,
in Sweave) construction process, but I cannot figure out what.  On my mac,
using "--compact-vignettes=both" when doing the build doesn't change the
vignette pdf size, but on other platforms it does.  qpdf and gs are
available to R on my mac, but weirdly, if I try to do the compacting
directly using

> tools::compactPDF(gs_quality = "ebook", "wnominate.pdf", verbose = TRUE)

I get back

qs_quality="ebook" : use_gs=TRUE, use_qpdf=TRUE
#{pdf}s = length(paths) = 1
- wnominate.pdf:    gs: res=0;  + qpdf: res=0;
    ==> (new=7.4894e+06)/(old=451405) = 16.5913 .. not worth using

This would (I think) suggest that the "compacting" would make the pdf 16.5
times bigger which seems like an issue.  On the other platforms, compacting
does what I expect.  It reduces the pdf file by about 50%.  I thought the
"uncompacted" vignette was the cause of the error when I originally
submitted to CRAN last night and got a similar error, so I rebuilt the
package using Docker and submitted that build.  However, no dice. So, maybe
the compacting issue is not related to what is hanging me up now.  In any
case, this is where I am right now.

I maintain this package for a friend who has retired and I thought the
tedious part of keeping it on CRAN was going to be bringing 4k+ lines of
legacy Fortran (sort of) into the 21th century, but I have now spent way
more time on this mysterious vignette building error.  I hope someone can
share a solution or even just a strategy for figuring this issue out.


Best,


Jeff

Regarding the vignette compacting issue, I ran into this recently and the problem was a bad build of Ghostscript on my Mac, which came from Homebrew. I downloaded GS directly and built locally and it worked correctly (though by now it may have been fixed at Homebrew).  Ivan Krylov figured this one out as he often does!  Thread starts at: https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-package-devel/2024q2/010666.html

It looks the the process terminates without producing an R-level error.
(E.g. putting q('no', status = 254) in a code block gave me a similar
result.)

I think you have been right about the Fortran code. Running R CMD check
compiled with -fsanitize=address,undefined gives me memory access
errors in both the examples and the vignette:

ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address 0x62500385b0c0

Subroutine WNOM overflows a REAL(4) buffer POOLE(NUMMEMBERS,NUMVOTES)
allocated for it inside R's .Fortran(). A breakpoint set at line 757
reveals that I is 21 and J is 101 at this point. This is to be
expected, given the two nested DO-loops for J=1,NRCALL (=NUMVOTES, 100)
and I=1,NP (=NUMMEMBERS, 20) in the preceding lines.

I think that the original code in version 1.4 was meant to extend both
loops until the line 109 CONTINUE, not to immediately end them with
1091 CONTINUE and 1092 CONTINUE after performing (NP*NRCALL)
assignments to the variable ICH, as done in version 1.5 (just
downloaded from the CRAN FTP server, subdirectory incoming/archive).

Hello,

I 'm new here! I'm the maintainer of a handful of packages and should have subscribed long ago.

Here's my problem. I didn't have time to deal with a compilation issue of my package milorGWAS a few months ago, and it has been archived.
I've now corrected the issue and I want to resubmit it. The following NOTE at check --as-cran interrupts the process. Can you please tell me how to deal with this situation?
Thanks in advance.
Yours, HP

I'm not sure what you mean by the note interrupting the process.  Did 
you submit it and get rejected?

To me the notes look as though they are for information only, with the 
possible exception that CRAN prefers abbreviations like GWAS to be 
written in single quotes as 'GWAS'.

You should definitely mention each of the issues that led to archiving 
in the note you submit with your package.

Actually none of the reported things led to rejection, but the quote was 
not complete, we also see

	"The Date field is over a month old."

so please update the Date field and resubmit.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] accessing data folder Warning/Error
Message-ID: <CAOj_JSUri2ZRPrdgGht5GR-GoSkm9ofpJoEUuScx+wSy1QsWpw@mail.gmail.com>

I am currently in the process of submitting a package to CRAN. I am having
difficulties with the example section in Summary.Rd

I placed the data in a folder called data-raw, which contains a metadata
file, textgrid file, and a README.md description of the data. This package
builds on existing software that generate these metadata and textgrids
files. The current package processes and plots this data.

When I run the R CMD check, the working directory is set to a folder
(.Rcheck) within the package, so I reset working directory with
setwd(".."), to be able to access the data-raw folder. This gives a
warning.

Is there a different way I can access my example dataset?

Thank you!
Yana Outkin

Unless I'm misunderstanding, it sounds like you're storing data that your
package requires in an external location. You need to put your data into
your R package and then access that data with system.file(package =
"<pkgname>", <path within package>)

Sometimes people will make a folder inst/extdata inside their R package
directory and then dump the data that the package requires in there. You
can see this link for more information:
https://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-exts.html#Data-in-packages

So, if you move your files into your R package, you should have a directory
inst/extdata/data-raw, and files inst/extdata/metadata,
inst/extdata/textgrid, and inst/extdata/README.md

When your package is installed, the contents of inst are unpacked into the
install directory. So, to refer to files after the package has been
installed and loaded, use:

system.file(package = "<pkgname>", "extdata", "data-raw", <more path>)
system.file(package = "<pkgname>", "extdata", "metadata")
...

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Packages required but not available
Message-ID: <a36322d4e7af4b17ab884a6d4a740f5a@uniba.it>

Dear all

I have just submitted a new version of the package SchoolDataIT 
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_SchoolDataIT.html>

On r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-gcc I got this error 
<https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-gcc/SchoolDataIT-00check.html> 
:

Result: ERROR
   Packages required but not available:
     'dplyr', 'ggplot2', 'readr', 'readxl', 'rvest', 'stringr', 'tidyr'

   Packages suggested but not available for checking: 'testthat', 
'tidyverse'

   See section ?The DESCRIPTION file? in the ?Writing R Extensions?
   manual.

If I don't get it wrong, this should be a version problem but I cannot 
figure out how to modify the DESCRIPTION in order to avoid this result.
Also I never noticed such problems with the old package version, though 
no version specification was included either (except for testthat) and 
the DESCRIPTION file had the same Imports and Suggestions fields

I have found this discussion on the posit community 
<https://forum.posit.co/t/package-required-but-not-available-error-on-cran/180047> 
but I am not sure if it is exactly the same case - also because the same 
platforms did not give any problem with tidyverse packages before.

Could somebody please help me understanding how to fix this?
Thank you very much in advance

With kindest regards
LC

Message-ID: <CAE3weNZaZX_innO3wQdh3Lbh6f+wMBwuvVMpk5MVKNt6jph2gg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

Recently, my R package {smile} was archived due to NOTES. At the time, I
was in the final stages of my PhD and unfortunately, I couldn't address the
issue in time to prevent the package from being archived.

Long story short, I fixed the issues, and now the `R CMD check --as-cran`
returns no notes (I'm on a Mac. However, when I submit the package to
"win-builder" to get it checked on Windows, I get the following NOTES:
"* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
Maintainer: 'Lucas da Cunha Godoy <lcgodoy at duck.com>'

New submission

Package was archived on CRAN

Possibly misspelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  ISSN (17:54)
  Moraga (13:60)
  al (14:9)
  et (13:67)

CRAN repository db overrides:
  X-CRAN-Comment: Archived on 2024-04-09 as issues were not corrected
    in time."

The "misspelled" words are author names included in the DESCRIPTION file as
references. Also, there is a note that the package is being archived.
I used GitHub workflows to get the package checked on Linux as well (see
here
<https://github.com/lcgodoy/smile/actions/runs/9486462259/job/26140848384>),
and there I got a note about sub-directories with more than 1Mb. To this
point, I don't believe I can further shrink those directories.

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to fix those issues to get the
package on CRAN?
My session info is below, just in case.

R version 4.3.2 (2023-10-31)
Platform: aarch64-apple-darwin20 (64-bit)
Running under: macOS Sonoma 14.5

Matrix products: default
BLAS:

LAPACK:
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib;
 LAPACK version 3.11.0

Thanks a lot,
Lucas.

This is actually an issue that was just fixed.

package:vctrs has an error when installing under r86723 because it creates
delayed bindings at package install time that cannot be restored at package
load time.

It may be a small while before the newest R devel version is in use by the
CRAN farm, but after that point package:vctrs will install successfully
again and you can submit your R package.

    As far as I know these are all harmless.

   * the first NOTE is for CRAN consumption
   * the rest are false positives

<CRAN_peeving>

The spell-checking machinery used in package checking is 
under-documented. There are some useful references here

https://github.com/r-lib/usethis/issues/1466

https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-package-devel/2017q3/001764.html

  I've been meaning to submit a patch to "Writing R Extensions" that 
would describe this, but so far I haven't. However, I also think that 
win-builder does *not* pay attention to the .aspell/ stuff documented 
above ...

If you run a spell checker before you submit  then it helps if you put in your cran-comments.md file  the list of words flagged and that all of them are correct. This makes it just a little easier for CRAN.
