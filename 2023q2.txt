1. Yes, remove the "lazyData" line from the DESCRIPTION file.

2. Do you have "stats" in the "Imports" line in the DESCRIPTION file? If 
not, put it in along with the "importFrom" line in the NAMESPACE file.

It sounds as though you're using Roxygen2 to generate your NAMESPACE 
file.  If so, you need @imports directives in the comments 
(conventionally before the function that uses the import, but I think it 
doesn't really matter where).

The error message seems pretty clear:  "The function xfun::isFALSE() 
will be deprecated in the future. Please consider using base::isFALSE(x) 
or identical(x, FALSE) instead".

So don't use xfun::isFALSE().

The error message means a function (knitr::opts_chunk$set) called
xfun::isFALSE() in lines 11-15 (lvpp.Rmd).
However, knitr::opts_chunk$set stopped using xfun::isFALSE().
See the commit shown below.
https://github.com/yihui/knitr/commit/ccb07c4c2266666f7375e5df242103672bd629ac

Updating knitr package should fix the error.

I tested your package on my Ubuntu machine and
got no error even after removing vignettes from .Rbuildignore.
I believe the cause of the error is not your package but your environment.

Best,
Shota Ochi

Almost there.

The 'qpdf' package interfaces to the same code that the 'qpdf' command
line tool uses to do its job. R CMD check uses the latter, not the
former. It looks like you're on Windows, so you need to install Rtools
in order to get a compatible version of 'qpdf':

I always get the warning about qpdf (on Windows) but it does not seem to 
be a problem on CRAN or winbuilder.

You have to have qpdf installed and on your PATH.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] OpenMP and CRAN checks
Message-ID: <SYCPR01MB40477F5D574DBBC27DD0F32BA9939@SYCPR01MB4047.ausprd01.prod.outlook.com>

Hi list,

We are having an issue with submitting a new version of the imager package to CRAN, and would like to understand how we are getting a particular NOTE. The package uses OpenMP for parallelisation of tasks. While we have a routine to set the number of threads that OpenMP should use (it internally issues a `omp_set_num_threads(threads)` call), we don't invoke it ourselves -- we let the users do it. None of our OpenMP pragmas set an explicit number of threads either. In other words, by default we use the system as-is.

In my environment (8 cores, 2 threads per core) I can see this working as expected. If I set the OMP_NUM_THREADS or OMP_THREAD_LIMIT environment variables to a given number before starting R, I can see that parallelisation stays within the given boundary. For example:

=================== examples============================
# No explicit limit, usually means "use all available cores"
$> Rscript -e 'library(foreach); library(imager); temp = foreach(1:100)%do%{as.cimg(matrix(rnorm(400^2),400,400))}; times = system.time(foreach(1:10)%do%{parmed(temp)}); print(times["user.self"]/times["elapsed"])' |& tail -n 1
15.75708

# 1 thread via OMP_THREAD_LIMIT
$> OMP_THREAD_LIMIT=1 Rscript -e 'library(foreach); library(imager); temp = foreach(1:100)%do%{as.cimg(matrix(rnorm(400^2),400,400))}; times = system.time(foreach(1:10)%do%{parmed(temp)}); print(times["user.self"]/times["elapsed"])' |& tail -n 1
0.994263

# 2 threads via OMP_NUM_THREADS
$> OMP_NUM_THREADS=2 Rscript -e 'library(foreach); library(imager); temp = foreach(1:100)%do%{as.cimg(matrix(rnorm(400^2),400,400))}; times = system.time(foreach(1:10)%do%{parmed(temp)}); print(times["user.self"]/times["elapsed"])' |& tail -n 1
1.994128
=================== examples============================

It is also our understanding (from [1], and more detailed in [2]) that the CRAN machines set OMP_THREAD_LIMIT=2 when running package checks to avoid package examples and vignettes from using more than 2 threads each, and thus be able to share the infrastructure as expected.

However, upon submission we received the following NOTE:

* checking examples ... [24s/21s] NOTE
Examples with CPU time > 2.5 times elapsed time
             user system elapsed ratio
cannyEdges 1.095  0.052   0.385 2.979

What I cannot explain is how, if OMP_THREAD_LIMIT is set, the example runs using more than 2 threads, therefor triggering such a NOTE. Isn't the OpenMP runtime supposed to limit the number of threads if this limit is set, hence limiting our parallelisation? I wouldn't single out this particular example: since OpenMP is used across the codebase it might be a question of good/bad luck which example triggers the warning. The code also doesn't spawn any child processes, all CPU utilisation stems from the main R process.

I do appreciate that we might have a future, different problem, where OMP_THREAD_LIMIT is specified but the code could still *try* to use more threads than the given limit (hence triggering a warning in some OpenMP platforms). That's the issue presented in [2], which they went and fixed -- but the limit should be obeyed by the OpenMP runtime in the first place, which is what puzzles me.

Any hints/help/guidance would be appreciated.

Regards,

Rodrigo

Thanks so much to all of you.  If you have time, I'm getting really
contradictory results.

1. It first seemed to have passed the check in Rstudio (I used
device::build() in the R window and then clicked on check in the drop down
menu under build).

==> devtools::check(document = FALSE, args = c('--as-cran'))
?? R CMD check results  Monte.Carlo.se 0.1.1 ????
Duration: 56.6s
0 errors ? | 0 warnings ? | 0 notes ?

R CMD check succeeded

However, I then couldn't find the tar.gz where it was supposed to be. It
was just gone.


Here is my namespace.  It says not to edit, but I had been told to add
the importFrom. So I didn't use
devtools::document() for fear roxygen2 would get rid of it.

# Generated by roxygen2: do not edit by hand
importFrom("stats", "cor", "sd", "var")
export(boot.se)
export(jack.se)
export(mc.se.matrix)
export(mc.se.vector)
export(pairwise.se)
export(sim.samp)

4. Here is my DESCRIPTION file

Package: Monte.Carlo.se
Type: Package
Title: Monte Carlo Standard Errors
Version: 0.1.1
Author: Dennis Boos, Kevin Matthew, Jason Osborne
Maintainer: Dennis Boos <boos at ncsu.edu>
Description: Computes Monte Carlo standard errors for summaries of
Monte Carlo output. Summaries and their standard errors are based on
columns of Monte Carlo simulation output. Dennis D. Boos and Jason A.
Osborne (2015) <doi:10.1111/insr.12087>.
License: GPL-3
Encoding: UTF-8
RoxygenNote: 7.2.3
Suggests: knitr, rmarkdown
Imports: stats
VignetteBuilder: knitr

5. And because of your advice: " It sounds as though you're using
Roxygen2 to generate your NAMESPACE file.
ff so, you need @imports directives in the comments
(conventionally before the function that uses the import, but I think it
doesn't really matter where)."

So I put "@imports" in the function that had trouble

#' @examples
#' \donttest{
#' # Using the output data matrix hold generated in vignette Example3,
#' # calculate jackknife and bootstrap standard errors
#' # for the differences and ratios of the CV estimates.
#' # First get the components of hold needed.
#'
#' @imports
#'
#' trim20 <- function(x){mean(x,.2)} # 20% trimmed mean function

Was that the correct thing to do?

6. And here are the failed check results. I'm clueless at this point.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] OpenMP and CRAN checks

Hi Rodrigo,

This came up recently again on social media where I illustrated how the
tiledb package deals with it. So a quick recap:

First off, let's make the goals clear.

We want to _simultaneously_
 - abide by CRAN Policy rules and cap ourselves to two cores there
 - do not impose any limits on our users: ALL cores ALL the time

The solution we implemented a while is to use a function _that is an opt-in_
which looks at the standard OpenMP variable as well as at R's own Ncpus:

    limitTileDBCores <- function(ncores, verbose=FALSE) {
      if (missing(ncores)) {
        ## start with a simple fallback: 'Ncpus' (if set) or else 2
        ncores <- getOption("Ncpus", 2L)
        ## also consider OMP_THREAD_LIMIT (cf Writing R Extensions), gets NA if envvar unset
        ompcores <- as.integer(Sys.getenv("OMP_THREAD_LIMIT"))
        ## and then keep the smaller
        ncores <- min(na.omit(c(ncores, ompcores)))
      }
      stopifnot(`The 'ncores' argument must be numeric or character` = is.numeric(ncores) || is.character(ncores))
      ## for brevity omitted here how ncores propagates to TileDB library -- creates `cfg`
      if (verbose) message("Limiting TileDB to ",ncores," cores. See ?limitTileDBCores.")
      invisible(cfg)
    }

The key is that we reflect the smaller of Ncpus and OMP_THREAD_LIMIT along
with a fall-back of two in case nothing is set.

That function is then called (and feeds into the library config) at the
beginning of each
 - help file example
 - unit test file
 - vignette

As example (from a help file) is

    \dontshow{ctx <- tiledb_ctx(limitTileDBCores())}

(where ctx a context object controlling, inter alia, the thread pool).

By throttling it anywhere CRAN executes code, and using the prescribed
maximum of two core, we satisfy goal one of not getting thrown off CRAN. By
making it an _explicit_ opt-in we satisfy our goal of never slowing down our
users who (presumably) do not opt in. And those who have, say, Ncpus set (as
I do to spread R's own package installations over all my cores) get the
maximum performance for examples, tests, and vignettes too as they opted in.

"Works for us" as they say.

Hope this helps,  Dirk

Your message is posted using HTML, which mangles a lot of it.  For 
example, the NAMESPACE file you posted has URLs mixed in with the text.

But if I can guess correctly what was in those files, it looks as though 
the package being checked doesn't have those files in it.  I don't know 
exactly what devtools::check does, but it's probably your problem.

I'd suggest this:  build the tarball, and check the tarball.

Strong second. The _Writing R Extensions_ manual does not mention devtools.
As Uwe often reminds everybody here the package is not used by CRAN either.

This may sound harsh but one of the key approaches to debugging often is to
strip away the layers to identify more atomic and minimal operations.  (And
RStudio can build the tarball for you too, see Build -> More -> Build Source
Package. Similarly you can ask it to not check the package using devtools.
You can always flip the switch back. Convenient helpers are useful, but at
times it is advisable to turn them off.)

`devtools::check()` calls `document()` automatically so your changes to
the NAMESPACE file get overwritten. You can see this in the output.

To solve this, add the appropriate roxygen2 tag somewhere in your package e.g.

```
#' @importFrom stats var sd etc
NULL
```

Hi Dennis,

I'm reincluding the list so that other people can see the clarifications too.

The roxygen code needs to be attached to some objects. You can include
the importFrom line as part of the docstring of another function but
since an import is often used in many functions it makes more sense to
declare them separately. Here I've used the `NULL` object for these
declarations, another option would have been "_PACKAGE", see
https://r-pkgs.org/man.html#sec-man-package-doc

In the devtools workflow we rarely work directly with tar.gz files. They
are created behind the scene in the temp folder. At submission time we
use `devtools::release()` to create and send the tarball to CRAN.

Of course it's also fine to use the manual workflow or mix both.

Best,
Lionel

Message-ID: <CAJiVmSCVmKoSTcGOeUoBHKWH8Yvf9X4Q2jmoy8X+tCW08pMmfg@mail.gmail.com>

My R package checks on my windows computer with no errors, warnings or
notes. Next I used the win-builder upload page to check the package. I
uploaded the tar.gz file on R-release. I read the 00check.log file and
the only Note stated was that I was the developer. I understood that I
needed to upload the file to both R-release and R-devel before I could
upload it to the cran.r-project.org/submit.html page. I tried to
upload the file to the R-devel, but I got the following message.

ERROR: Access to the path
'C:\Inetpub\ftproot\R-devel\daewr_1.2-9.tar.gz' is denied. (perhaps
you uploaded already and the file has not been processed yet?)

It has been 4 days since I uploaded the file to R-release, and I get
automatic emails every other day from Uwe Ligges telling me my package
has been checked and built.

What checks are required before uploading the package tar.gz file to
the cran.r-project.org/submit.html page?

This might need some help from Uwe Ligges to resolve the package queue
problems.

The policy strongly recommends checking the package with R-devel but
doesn't require you to use Win-Builder. You can get R-devel for Windows
from <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rdevel.html> and run
R CMD check from that.

If you don't want to install additional software, you can use R-hub
<https://builder.r-hub.io/advanced> and other package checking services.
They don't run exactly the same software on exactly the same hardware
as CRAN checks, but they do fulfil the requirement to have your package
checked by R-devel.

Hi Dirk,

Thanks for your response. In a way this is more or less what I knew we would have to end up doing (i.e., explicit limit ourselves to 2 CPUs maximum for anything running on CRAN), but it still confuses me why this didn't just happen, given how CRAN sets OMP_THREAD_LIMIT=2 already, which should constrain us automatically.

I've taken your advice onboard and put in a very similar function that I am then invoking in all examples, tests and vignettes. Our code uses roxygen2, and there are 150 @examples in the inline documentation, so a midly complex sed command did the trick. The vignettes and tests were not as bad.

We'll try a resubmission and see how we fare.

Thanks again,

Rodrigo

Betreff: Re: [R-pkg-devel] OpenMP and CRAN checks


Hi Rodrigo,

This came up recently again on social media where I illustrated how the
tiledb package deals with it. So a quick recap:

First off, let's make the goals clear.

We want to _simultaneously_
 - abide by CRAN Policy rules and cap ourselves to two cores there
 - do not impose any limits on our users: ALL cores ALL the time

The solution we implemented a while is to use a function _that is an opt-in_
which looks at the standard OpenMP variable as well as at R's own Ncpus:

    limitTileDBCores <- function(ncores, verbose=FALSE) {
      if (missing(ncores)) {
        ## start with a simple fallback: 'Ncpus' (if set) or else 2
        ncores <- getOption("Ncpus", 2L)
        ## also consider OMP_THREAD_LIMIT (cf Writing R Extensions), gets NA if envvar unset
        ompcores <- as.integer(Sys.getenv("OMP_THREAD_LIMIT"))
        ## and then keep the smaller
        ncores <- min(na.omit(c(ncores, ompcores)))
      }
      stopifnot(`The 'ncores' argument must be numeric or character` = is.numeric(ncores) || is.character(ncores))
      ## for brevity omitted here how ncores propagates to TileDB library -- creates `cfg`
      if (verbose) message("Limiting TileDB to ",ncores," cores. See ?limitTileDBCores.")
      invisible(cfg)
    }

The key is that we reflect the smaller of Ncpus and OMP_THREAD_LIMIT along
with a fall-back of two in case nothing is set.

That function is then called (and feeds into the library config) at the
beginning of each
 - help file example
 - unit test file
 - vignette

As example (from a help file) is

    \dontshow{ctx <- tiledb_ctx(limitTileDBCores())}

(where ctx a context object controlling, inter alia, the thread pool).

By throttling it anywhere CRAN executes code, and using the prescribed
maximum of two core, we satisfy goal one of not getting thrown off CRAN. By
making it an _explicit_ opt-in we satisfy our goal of never slowing down our
users who (presumably) do not opt in. And those who have, say, Ncpus set (as
I do to spread R's own package installations over all my cores) get the
maximum performance for examples, tests, and vignettes too as they opted in.

"Works for us" as they say.

Hope this helps,  Dirk

Interesting, you shouild receive one mail for each upload.
Can yoiu tell me when you got an unexpected one? Can you forward it to me?

I do not see a package in any of the queues right now.

Message-ID: <BN7PR05MB3972AF918C1ACF444332BF17C8969@BN7PR05MB3972.namprd05.prod.outlook.com>

I was checking the CRAN check page for my package BAS https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_BAS.html

and saw that there has been an ERROR in the check status for r-release-macosx-arm64 for (at least) the last 2 days.   Looking at the check results linked there the package fails installation as it cannot locate the quadmath library:

https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-release-macos-arm64/BAS-00install.html

I am preparing for any update of the package and current testing using mac-builder for r-release and r-devel return no errors, warnings, etc.  (although it appears that r-release for the testing server is using R 4.2.1 ???)

Is this a false positive that may be ignored on submission of a new version or are there any other updates for packages using C/fortran on M1macs that I need to update.   (Can't find quadmath explicitly in WRE, but may have not searched optimally)

In my Makefile I have

??????PKG_LIBS = $(LAPACK_LIBS) $(BLAS_LIBS) $(FLIBS)

source code is at https://github.com/merliseclyde/BAS

TIA
Merlise

Message-ID: <CAPcHnpSNsci0TVO0Oz5YOgHOZv6PZ92Ggt-8ia+CVp-7Sawf2Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,


I'm changing my name and my email address. I've got an update I'd like to
submit to CRAN, I've changed my name and email in my DESCRIPTION.

I couldn't find any details about changing maintainers in the R manuals
unfortunately. Someone online said to just submit the update, CRAN will
send one email to the new address confirming the submission, and another to
the old address confirming the new maintainer. Someone else said to email
CRAN from the old address about the new maintainer and their address, and
wait for a response of approval before submission. It was unclear if that
would be CRAN-submissions at R-project.org or CRAN at R-project.org, but I'd
guess the first.

Has anyone else done this before or does anyone know the best procedure?
Also, given that this isn't a transfer of ownership, I'm still the same
person with a different name, would that make this process easier?


Thank you!

Just submit your package, and you'll get an automated email to the old address.

It is in the CRAN policies.

Yes, that's true.

THis is also a true option. Personally I'd prefer the first way.

Same process as we do not know whether it is the same person behind the 
other mail address.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Problems on R-devel because of changes in stats
 family function
Message-ID: <AM0PR01MB4369F5226E6481DAF9C1C664B99A9@AM0PR01MB4369.eurprd01.prod.exchangelabs.com>

Hi,

When submitting a new version of my LMMsolver package to CRAN, it fails on the automated tests, see:

Windows: https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/LMMsolver_1.0.5_20230407_120945/Windows/00check.log

I managed to track this down to a change in the output of the family function in the stats package:
https://search.r-project.org/R/refmans/stats/html/family.html

More specifically, it is about a new output in the call to family():

dispersion
(optional since R version 4.3.0) numeric: value of the dispersion parameter, if fixed, or NA_real_ if free.

Even though the documentation seems to suggest this output is optional, I don't see a way to suppress it. In all my calls to family I get an extra output dispersion with value NA.
I need to store the family information in my own outputs for further processing. Also my output are quite complex by themselves so I tend to check my full output objects with outputs previously stored.
Exactly this is giving me problems now. In R 4.3 all of my outputs will have an extra item as well, causing the tests to fail.

I am not sure how to solve this. I could suppress the affected tests when an installation of stats with version >= 4.3 is detected, but that doesn't feel good.
Do you have any other suggestions on how to solve this.

Thanks in advance,
Bart-Jan

One way to solve it would be to set the dispersion parameter to NULL 
before doing your comparison.  That should work across R versions.  For 
example,

    f <- gaussian()
    f$dispersion <- NULL
    expect_equal_to_reference(f, "family")

Another possibility would be to save two reference values, e.g.

    f <- gaussian()
    expect_equal_to_reference(f, if (getRversion() < 4.3.0) "oldfamily" 
else "newfamily")

You should do some sort of manual comparison when those two reference 
values are first created to make sure there are no other changes.

Dear All,
I trust this email finds you doing well.

I had planned to release a new version of my package, and everything was checking perfectly on my machine and using the???devtools? functions check_win_oldrelease(), check_win_release(), and check_win_devel().

However, after submitting the package to CRAN, I have been notified that the package does not pass the automatic incoming checks. I had a look at the log file (https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/movecost_2.0_20230412_090758/Windows/00check.log) and I see two notes which I do not understand:

* checking HTML version of manual ... [6s] NOTE
Encountered the following conversion/validation errors:
'CreateProcess' failed to run 'd:\rtools43\x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix\bin\tidy.exe -language en -qe --drop-empty-elements no D:\temp\Rtmp29JsRe\file2426857b24734'

* checking for detritus in the temp directory ... NOTE
Found the following files/directories: 'lastMiKTeXException'

Do you have any suggestion as to what can possibly cause those issues, and how to fix them?

Thanks

The tidy.exe program is used in some checks of help files.  The error 
messages you have say that it failed to run.  I think that was an issue 
on the CRAN machine, not an issue with your package, so I'd follow the 
instructions in the email you received from CRAN to let them know the 
rejection appears to be a false positive.

This is a (transient?) problem on the machine running the check:
something completely prevented HTML Tidy from running, even before the
process would have tried to load the required DLLs. Nothing to do with
your package.

I think this is a false positive too. Some other package may have
failed to compile its PDF documentation (at the same time?), which
caused MiKTeX to create this file in the temp directory. Your PDF
manual check resulted in an OK.

Does the automatic e-mail include the instructions on where to reply
with this explanation?

Hello,
Thanks for your prompt advices.

I am not an expert?.

I have sent an email to explain that those are likely to be issues on the CRAN?s end, and to inform that I would not mind to wait a while and re-do the entire submission procedure.

Thank you again
Gm

Hello!

I need some help.

Could you explain how to write the *Description* field in the *Description*
file when we need to add links? I don't find any rules on how to write it
when it includes links such as <https://...>

Also, whenever I try to do a new line in the *Description* field with the
four spaces for indentation, I get an error from the R CMD

If you could provide me with some sort of template example, I would be
extremely grateful.

Best,

Socorro

Hi,

The Writing R Packages manual is the main documentation, specifically:
https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#The-DESCRIPTION-file

As for indentation, don't. Just use a newline.

I don't know of any templates, but the source code for many/most
packages is on RForge and/or github, so you can look at as many
DESCRIPTION files as you'd like to find the solutions you need.

If that doesn't help, then please share actual examples of what isn't
working in your file.

Thank you!

So, based on this link:
https://r-pkgs.org/description.html#:~:text=to%20be%20indented%3A-,Description,-%3A%20The%20description
<https://r-pkgs.org/description.html#:~:text=to%20be%20indented%3A-,Description,-%3A%20The%20descriptio>
I thought I had to add indentations...

So, I originally sent:
```
Description: Access and manipulate data from the Neotoma Paleoecology
Database. <https://api.neotomadb.org/api-docs/>
```

I was requested to add <https://..> referencing the "Neotoma Paleoecology
Database".

With the Description above, I do not get any local errors when running the
R CMD but can rejects it and gives me this error:


If I do this:
```
Description: Access and manipulate data from the Neotoma Paleoecology
Database.
<https://api.neotomadb.org/api-docs/>
```

and run the R CMD, I get the following message:
```
Unknown, possibly mis-spelled, fields in DESCRIPTION:
  ?<https?
```
(however, it is not an error)


I see that I have to write complete sentences, so I have done the following:
```
Description: Access and manipulation of data using the Neotoma Paleoecology
Database.
<https://api.neotomadb.org/api-docs/>
```

I would llike to know if this is correct prior to submitting again. Or know
how should I place that <https...> tag

Thank you for all your help.

Make sure you have a period after the < > tag if that is the end of the paragraph/sentences - its is not clear it is there from the snippet that you sent.
(let us know if the package is on github as then we can see the entire file)

Thank you all,

I really appreciate how fast you have all helped me and I am very grateful
for it.

I did not have a space. I wonder why it is rendering like that. I removed
the line and wrote it again just in case a weird character had gotten in
the way. Now I have done as you have suggested.

When I did the R CMD I had no issues locally and I had no more notes or
elements being interpreted as fields.

Thank you,

Socorro

You put a space between "https:" and "//", you should definitely remove
that. Also, you need to indent your description. Right now, your
DESCRIPTION is being interpreted in this manner:

```
Package






               "neotoma2"






                    Title





                                                     "Working with the
Neotoma Paleoecology Database"






                     Date






             "2023-04-17"






                  Version






                  "1.0.0"






                Authors at R
"\n    c(person(given = \"Dominguez Vidana\",\n             family =
\"Socorro\",\n             role = c(\"aut\"),\n             email = \"
s.dominguez at ht-data.com\",\n             comment =
structure(\"0000-0002-7926-4935\", .Names = \"ORCID\")),\n
 person(given = \"Simon\",\n             family = \"Goring\",\n
role = c(\"aut\", \"cre\"),\n             email = \"goring at wisc.edu\",\n
          comment = structure(\"0000-0002-2700-4605\", .Names =
\"ORCID\")))"






                      URL





                                                              "
https://github.com/NeotomaDB/neotoma2"






               BugReports





                                                       "
https://github.com/NeotomaDB/neotoma2/issues"






              Description





                           "Access and manipulation of data using the
Neotoma Paleoecology Database."






                   <https





                                                                    "//
api.neotomadb.org/api-docs/>."






                  License
```

You can see that it is interpreting "<https" as the name of a field and "//
api.neotomadb.org/api-docs/>." as the contents of the field. I added 8
spaces before "<https:" and removed the space and it worked perfectly fine.

I hope this helps.

Thanks for posting a link to the repo. That should really be a standard.

You currently have (and I indent by two spaces for clarity here)

  Description: Access and manipulation of data using the Neotoma Paleoecology Database.
          <https://api.neotomadb.org/api-docs/>.

which has two full stops. I would simply use

  Description: Access and manipulation of data using the Neotoma Paleoecology
    Database at <https://api.neotomadb.org/api-docs/>.

which brings the URL into the description text while keeping it one sentence
with one full stop.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Replacing dplyr by stats functions
Message-ID: <20230419083626.5DCCDA029E@poczta.interia.pl>

Hi,

I am developing my own package. I have a problem with its new version. Checking on the CRAN server gives 2 warnings like this (critpath is my package):
Warning: replacing previous import 'dplyr::lag' by 'stats::lag' when loading 'critpath'
Warning: replacing previous import 'dplyr::filter' by 'stats::filter' when loading 'critpath'

On my machine these warnings show up during Check but before Build starts so at the end I get a message that the number of warnings is 0. I don't use lag or filter at all in my package although I use both of these packages. Reordering the dplyr and stats package names in the Depends of the Description file didn't help. Is it a problem with my code or a conflict between those two packages? Please help me remove these warnings.

Best regards

Adam

 ??? If you use Depends: in your package I think this is unavoidable 
(but, I don't think these should be counted against you as warnings by 
CRAN - they're "Warnings" not "WARNINGs" :-) )

 ?? The only way I know of to avoid this would be to Import: rather than 
Depend:, and import only the functions you need.

Hi Adam,

If you don't mind adding another dependency to your package, you can
use the {conflicted} package and its conflict_prefer function.

Best,
Ahmadou

It's a conflict between stats and dplyr. The dplyr lag() function
masks the base R stats lag() generic, which breaks S3 method dispatch
for every package that has a lag() method when dplyr is attached.

You should use Imports instead of Depends unless you need the package
attached, which is a rare case.

The latest version of critpath on CRAN uses `import()` in the
NAMESPACE file. That imports every function in the entire package. Use
`importFrom()` to import only the functions you use from the package.
That should help avoid these types of conflicts.

Message-ID: <AS8PR03MB101195FCD51D3690649B9AA30D3609@AS8PR03MB10119.eurprd03.prod.outlook.com>

Hi all,
I wanted to publish my RITCH package (https://github.com/DavZim/RITCH) to CRAN, which has Rcpp code.
It has, in it?s CICD Pipeline, Tests for Macos, Windows, and Ubuntu (devel, release,, and oldrel-1), which all succeed on Github Actions.
When I submitted the package to CRAN, I was notified, that I got the following error on Debian (the tests on Windows throw no such bug, neither do the Github Actions tests):


   *** caught segfault ***

  address 0x55939b7ca000, cause 'memory not mapped'

  Segmentation fault

The full Report is currently available here: https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/RITCH_0.1.14_20230420_223157/Debian/00check.log (note the error happens in the test_filter_itch.R unit tests).

I looked for the error online but couldn?t find anything useful, and as I am not able to reproduce the segfault locally, cannot debug it.
Do you have any ideas or hunches what might cause this and how to resolve it?

Thank you,
David

"Absence of error" on one platform does proove correctness on all, the hint
from the segfault should be taken seriously.  I just updated my older
checkout of your repo, built a current tarball and simply invoked

   R CMD check --use-valgrind RITCH_0.1.14.tar.gz

which you could do on CI too (I can help as needed, I would also pull the CI
runners forward from Ubuntu 20.04 to 22.04). When we do the above, the
examples output file RITCH-Ex.Rout ends in

Hi David,

In addition to running under valgrind as Dirk suggests below, you
should also run under UBSAN and ASAN.

You can do all 3 (and more) using Winston Cheng's docker images:
https://github.com/wch/r-debug/

That should help you narrow down the problematic code.

Best,
Josh

Thank you Dirk and Joshua,
Using Valgrind, I have found several memory leaks in the program that required some smaller rewrites.
Valgrind (with Makevars flags -O0 and --ggdb) now reports no "definitely" and no "indirectly" lost bytes so that's a small win already.

But two questions remain:

  1.  I have 960 bytes "possibly lost", where the callstack does not touch any of my code but seems to originate from subset.c (base R?) and libgomp, is this ok/expected, or am I misreading the output?
  2.  For all tests that I ran, there are still 105mln bytes still reachable. I read online that this can be problematic, but usually isn't. Is this something that I should invest more time in or can I ignore this?

Thank you very much!
David


To reproduce the valgrind output using bash (this is using the latest code commit https://github.com/DavZim/RITCH/commit/13ea3f478717edf24f8db709f0cac1e22b501afc)

Hi David,

In addition to running under valgrind as Dirk suggests below, you
should also run under UBSAN and ASAN.

You can do all 3 (and more) using Winston Cheng's docker images:
https://github.com/wch/r-debug/

That should help you narrow down the problematic code.

Best,
Josh

It is difficult to say something _definite_ with a language like R that
manages memory dynamically. This is fundamentally different from C/C++ which
valgrind was written for.  So _ex ante_ you are in good news territory.  When
I am in doubt I sometimes compare to valgrind output (using the same
parameters) on a known-good package. You could try xts or zoo, for example,
or another package equally focused on creating data objects from binary files
as RITCH is.

The log below mentions GOMP. Might be worthwhile opening another branch in
your repo and throwing OpenMP out, or forcing a single thread, or ... for
another test. 

The additional ASAN/UBSAN tests mentioned by Josh are a good idea too -- and
CRAN runs them anyway (as part of the add-on test suites running from a
well-known university town in southern England...)

Best,  Dirk

Message-ID: <a864d643-b3d6-09c8-3956-657763573859@gmail.com>

   Submission of most recent version of lme4 threw a NOTE on CRAN's 
Debian platform that we had not seen when running "R CMD check 
--as-cran" with the most recent SVN checkout, nor when submitted to 
win-builder/R-devel.  These are legitimate issues (all now fixed), but 
we were taken by surprise because they weren't detected on any platforms 
we tested on.

   So far, archaeology in the R code base/Github mirror about recent 
changes to tools::checkS3methods, or about environment variables, hasn't 
been entirely successful, although based on

grep Sys.getenv src/library/tools/R/QC.R  | sed -e 's/.*Sys.getenv("//' 
| sed -e 's/"[,)].*//' | sort | uniq

it looks like we *might* want to set

_R_CHECK_S3_METHODS_SHOW_POSSIBLE_ISSUES_

when testing ...

   This is mostly a heads-up/documentation for anyone who might be 
interested.

Message-ID: <25669.19936.694972.114117@rob.eddelbuettel.com>


The URL ${CRAN}/bin/macosx/R-latest.pkg is in fairlt widespread use. A quick
Google query [1] reveals about 1.1k hits. And it happens to be used too in a
CI job a colleague noticed failing yesterday.

The bin/macosx/ page now prominently displays both leading flavours
  R-4.3.0-arm64.pkg
  R-4.3.0-x86_64.pkg
which makes sense give the architecture choices. We can of course update the
CI script, and likely will.

But given that this was apparently a somewhat widely-used URL to fetch R on
macOS, may I suggest that the convenience link be reestablished as a courtesy?

Dirk,

thanks - the problem is that there is not a single installer package (for several years now), so that URL is ambiguous. Whether the missing link is a good or bad depends on how it is used. I would argue that any link to that URL is inherently bad, because there is no way of knowing that the link works for a particular system - that's why I have originally removed it with the R 4.3.0 release. I have restored it now, making it point to the R 4.3.0 arm64 release since that is arguably the closest to a single "latest R". R releases have not been stored in /bin/macosx since 2015, so anyone using a link there is asking for trouble.

For any CI I would strongly recommend using the "last-success" links: https://mac.r-project.org/big-sur/last-success/ in particular the .xz versions are they are specifically designed to be used by CI (small download, fast and localized install).

Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] How to format the NEWS.md file for CRAN submissions?
Message-ID: <CAM2gKPbCPo6Y46e3QhCpC9uBTHqDsYmEdKKdKZ=AkbtgtQ_KGQ@mail.gmail.com>

My package is creating a CRAN check NOTE because CRAN does not like the way
my NEWS.md file [1] is formatted.

I am largely adhering to existing conventions with regards to my NEWS.md,
in particular the (rather minimal) GNU conventions [2] mentioned in R-exts
as well as the conventions used by ?pkgdown? to compile the file into a web
page. The one peculiarity of my NEWS.md file (and where it diverges from
the documented ?pkgdown? convention) is caused by the fact that my package
has undergone a name change in the past. As a consequence, not all headings
in the NEWS.md file follow the format `# ?pkgname? ?version?`.
Consequently, the CRAN check complains

>   Cannot extract version info from the following section titles:
>     modules 0.x

I have two questions:

1. Am I overlooking where the CRAN requirements for NEWS files are
documented? As far as I can see I am not violating a documented rule.
2. What is the best way of avoiding this NOTE _without_ dropping the
changelog pre package name change? In particular, since ?pkgdown? does not
support this I would like keep these changes in a single NEWS.md file
rather than moving them into a separate file. Likewise, I think it would be
misleading (and hence undesirable) to change the section headings to use
the current package name for the old revisions.

The documentation is in the ?util::news help topic.  It says:

"File ?NEWS.md? should contain the news in Markdown (following the 
CommonMark (https://commonmark.org/) specification), with the primary 
heading level giving the version number after a prefix followed by a 
space, and optionally followed by a space and a parenthesized ISO 8601 
format date."

I don't think it cares what the prefix is, so you could use something 
other than the current package name there.

I upgraded to 4.3.0 and rebuilt and checked a package with --as-cran, 
receiving

* checking PDF version of manual ... OK
* checking HTML version of manual ...Warning in file(con, "r") :
   cannot open file '/usr/lib/R/doc/html/katex/katex.js': No such file 
or directory
Error in file(con, "r") : cannot open the connection
Execution halted

Never heard of 'katex' but googled and found it interesting to try, so I 
installed the R package katex and, on my ubuntu system:

$ sudo apt install katex

but I still get the error with R CMD check --as-cran. What am I missing?
Obviously /usr/lib/R/doc/html/katex/katex.js (no 'doc'), but ...

I am installing R via apt.

Thanks, G?ran

Thank you for mentioning this detail!

At least in Debian packages, R's copy of KaTeX lives in /usr/share: per
Debian policy, "share" is for human-readable files like KaTeX, and
"lib" is for shared libraries, compiled code and the like.

For a copy of R built from source, it's not a problem:
file.path(R.home(), 'doc', 'html') does point to where KaTeX lives.

For a copy of R packaged into *.deb, the right path can be obtained
using file.path(R.home("doc"), "html"):

Thanks. I have now built R from source and can confirm that everything 
works nicely. Can't remember when and why I stopped building R from 
source, probably not a good idea.

Yes, that is a distribution-wide preference other Linux distributions have
too, and that was turned on many, many years ago in Debian (glancing at
changelog: one reference to 1999 when Doug was still maintainer; otherwise
mostly in 2006 it seems).

It does make R depart from the 'everything below RHOME' model, but the
relevant changes have mostly been caught.

Nice catch. In favour. Would you mind filing a bugzilla report to make sure

I ran into the same issue (on Ubuntu 20.04).

I just copied everything from /usr/share/R/doc to /usr/lib/R:

A bit of a hack but then everything works fine.

Best,
Wolfgang

That is rather bad as you create lots of 'orphan' files your package manager
does not know about.  We really should not be advertise this in public
without strong disclaimers (which you added, so thanks).

This whole thread would have been well at home on r-sig-debian.

Yeah, I know -- like I said, hack / not recommended / should handle this properly.

I spent a few hours yesterday rebuilding my package library because I build all packages from source -- really should start using r2u (thanks!) -- so once I got that issue, I was just trying to move on to get some work done.

Best,
Wolfgang

Hi Duncan,

Thanks, that?s perfect. So the issue in my case was the ?0.0.x? version
instead of the package name. That?s easily fixable, as verified by running
`utils::news()` on my package.

Cheers,
Konrad

I have restored it now, making it point to the R 4.3.0 arm64 release since that is arguably the closest to a single "latest R". R releases have not been stored in /bin/macosx since 2015, so anyone using a link there is asking for trouble.

That is a fine idea but no replacement as it leads to a need for a different

Maybe you are someone wants to wrap that into a suitable script or 'action

Message-ID: <20230426180006.445b9bcb@arachnoid>

Hello R-package-devel members,

I've got an idea for a package. I'm definitely reinventing a wheel, but
I couldn't find anything that would fulfil 100% of my requirements.

I've got a computational experiment that takes a while to complete, but
the set of machines that can run it varies during the day. For example,
I can leave a computer running in my bedroom, but I'd rather turn it
off for the night. For now, I work around the problem with a lot of
caching [*], restarting the job with different cluster geometries and
letting it load the parts that are already done from the disk.

Here's a proof of concept implementation of a server that sits between
the clients and a pool of compute nodes, dynamically distributing the
tasks between the nodes: https://github.com/aitap/nodepool

In addition to letting nodes come and go as they like, it also doesn't
strain R's NCONNECTIONS limit on nodes and clients (although the pool
would still benefit from it being increased) and only requires the pool
to be available for inbound connections [**].

It's definitely not CRAN quality yet and at the very least needs a
better task submission API, but it does seem to work. Does it sound
like it could be useful in your own work? Any ideas I could implement,
besides those mentioned in the README?

Here's a terrible hack: the pool speaks R's cluster protocol. One
could, in theory, construct a mock-"cluster" object consisting of
connections to the pool server and use parLapplyLB to distribute a
number of tasks between the pool nodes. But that's a bad idea for a lot
of reasons.

[*] I need caching anyway because some of my machines have hardware
problems and may just reboot for no reason.

parallelly::makeClusterPSOCK() makes it much less of a problem.

Hi all,

I'm hoping you can help me understand this new CRAN check failure that 
occurs on Debian but not on Windows:

Debian:<https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/smaa_0.3-2_20230424_202447/Debian/00check.log>
Status: 1 NOTE

This error was not raised by previous versions and I did not change the 
NEWS file for this version. The same package passes the same check on 
Debian r-devel on r-hub (see the full build log: HTML 
<https://builder.r-hub.io/status/smaa_0.3-2.tar.gz-6ab795be6475b44b1ec363a82c45a2cb>,

<https://artifacts.r-hub.io/smaa_0.3-2.tar.gz-6ab795be6475b44b1ec363a82c45a2cb>.)

I couldn't find any documentation regarding this error or a clear 
specification of how NEWS should be formatted. I had understood it t be 
a plain text file.

Thanks in advance,

Gert

Unfortunately, not all checks are enabled on all check machines.

Your NEWS file at
<https://github.com/gertvv/rsmaa/blob/master/smaa/NEWS> looks like
valid Markdown to me. In fact, I can parse it using R's NEWS.md parser
without any warnings, so in order to solve the problem, you just need
to rename it to NEWS.md.

R's requirements for "plain text" NEWS files are documented in
help(news) (together with requirements for NEWS.md and NEWS.Rd).

Are they running R CMD check without --as-cran? This could be the
reason why they didn't pick up this problem sooner. Running
rhub::check_for_cran() will run a more comprehensive set of checks on
your package.

To reproduce this, you can use tools:::.news_reader_default(), e.g.

> utils::download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gertvv/rsmaa/master/smaa/NEWS", "NEWS", quiet = TRUE)
> news <- tools:::.news_reader_default("NEWS")
Warning messages:
1: Cannot process chunk/lines:
  smaa 0.3-0
2: Cannot process chunk/lines:
  smaa 0.2-5
...
9: Cannot process chunk/lines:
  smaa 0.1

You can check for attribute 'bad' to detect if there are parsing errors, e.g.

> bad <- which(attr(news, "bad"))
> news[bad, "Version"]
[1] "0.3-0" "0.2-5" "0.2-4" "0.2-3" "0.2-2" "0.2-1" "0.2"   "0.1-1" "0.1"

I have a check_news() [0] that does this job for me (it checks both
NEWS and NEWS.md), e.g.

> check_news("NEWS")
Error: Detected 9 malformed entries in 'NEWS': 0.3-0, 0.2-5, 0.2-4,
0.2-3, 0.2-2, 0.2-1, 0.2, 0.1-1, 0.1

Hope this helps,

/Henrik

Dear Ivan,

Yes, this is *definitely* very useful in my own work. In fact, I had thought about writing something like this myself!

Can you clarify what happens if a node disconnects from the pool while it is running some assigned task? I assume/hope the pool server keeps track of that and will then submit the nonfinished task to another node.

Also, are there any issues with using the pool machine also as a node?

PS: In the README, 'cliends' -> 'clients'.

Best,
Wolfgang

This is exactly what happens. In the function that removes a node from
the pool, there is a check for a pending task associated with that
node. If such a task is found, it's put back at the end of the queue.

(So if you accidentally create a task that crashes a node in a way that
cannot be caught by tryCatch(), it will eventually take the whole pool
offline. On the other hand, if the nodes are automatically restarted,
they will run all other tasks in the queue before encountering the
crashing task again.)

I'd like to write an integration test that would create a pool with two
nodes, send two tasks consisting of Sys.sleep() to them, then crash one
of the nodes after they accept the tasks. Even without the crashing
(which could be part of the task, if (node_destined_to_crash) q('no')),
this is some hair-raising code: I need multiple child processes running
with the same temporary library where the package version being tested
is installed, and also some synchronisation between them.

> Also, are there any issues with using the pool machine also as a node?

There shouldn't be. In fact, I should probably add a parameter to the
run_pool() function that automatically creates a number of nodes on the
same machine.

Thanks!
