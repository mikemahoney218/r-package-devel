Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Problem with "compacting" pdf files.
Message-ID: <20231001211547.4c46512e@rolf-Latitude-E7470>


When I submitted an update of my Iso package a short time ago, it was
rejected as not passing the incoming checks automatically.  Explicitly,
I got a WARNING:

> * checking sizes of PDF files under 'inst/doc' ... WARNING
> 'gs+qpdf' made some significant size reductions:
>      compacted 'algorithm.pdf' from 394Kb to 99Kb
>   consider running tools::compactPDF(gs_quality = "ebook") on these
> files

I did as instructed and ran

    tools::compactPDF("./algorithm.pdf",gs_quality="ebook")

having started R in the inst/vignettes directory, which is where the
file algorithm.pdf is to be found.

According to "ls -l" the size of algorithm.pdf was about 109 Kb. before
I ran compactPDF() and about 90 Kb. afterward.

I do not understand:

    * the reference to inst/doc (there is no such directory)
    * where the sizes 349 Kb and 99 Kb come from
    * what I have to do to get Iso to pass the required checks

The email that I received from CRAN (under the return address
ligges at statistik.tu-dortmund.de) said:

> If you are not sure how to fix the problems shown, please ask for

Consequently I am asking! Can anyone set me on the path to
enlightenment?  Thanks.

When you run R CMD build in order to produce a new Iso-*.tar.gz, R runs
Sweave and pdflatex on vignettes/algorithm.Rnw in order to produce
inst/doc/algorithm.pdf inside the resulting tarball (but not the
original source tree on your computer).

Does it help to run R CMD build --compact-vignettes=both? This should
let R run tools::compactPDF on inst/doc/algorithm.pdf it generates
before placing it inside the package tarball.

I think that R doesn't know anything about files under inst/vignettes
in the source tree.

Thanks Ivan.  That may well be the key.  When I unpacked the tarball
created without the --compact-vignettes=both flag, I found that
inst/doc/algorithm.pdf had size 403 Kb, whereas with that flag set
it had size 108 Kb.

I'll re-submit now and see what happens.

I *really* think that the instructions from CRAN could have been
clearer!  Without your guidance I'd have been at a total loss.

cheers,

Rolf

You do *not* have to declare base-R packages as dependencies in the
DESCRIPTION file.  'R CMD check' and 'R CMD check --as-cran' will not
complain about them.

I can't speak for others, but, I choose to declare all(*) my base-R
package dependencies in my DESCRIPTION files for a reason.  This makes
it explicit what packages my package rely on, including which of the
base-R packages.  For instance, it's nice to be able to tell when the
'parallel' or 'tcltk' package is used from the DESCRIPTION file (and
the online CRAN package page, if on CRAN).

(*) The exception is the 'base' package, because that is such a
fundamental package in R and is always loaded.  The other base-R
packages are theoretically optional when it comes to running R, e.g.

$ R_ENABLE_JIT=0 Rscript --vanilla --default-packages=base -e
"loadedNamespaces()"
[1] "base"

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Rmarkdown package vignette that reference online
 images: how to fail gracefully?
Message-ID: <CA+2Dmwj1LG6+gLTLG1aA7FGourHEQ39r4qPOPBq6SNzSv4v2Vw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear members of R-package-devel,

CRAN has the following policy: Packages which use Internet resources
should fail gracefully with an informative message if the resource is
not available or has changed (and not give a check warning nor error).

I have a CRAN-accepted package with vignettes that use Rmarkdown. One
of the vignettes involves a lot of images, so rather than embed the
raw images in the vignette, I reference the images on Flickr (to keep
the package size small enough to be hosted on CRAN). Every half year
or so, I'll get a message from CRAN maintainers that the package is
not failing gracefully on one of their servers due to their build and
testing processes.  The error message looks as follows:

Could not fetch
https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52281215570_5f9cc90a12_o.png
     HttpExceptionRequest Request {
      host = "live.staticflickr.com"
      port = 443
      secure = True
      requestHeaders = []
      path = "/65535/52281215570_5f9cc90a12_o.png"
      queryString = ""
      method = "GET"
      proxy = Nothing
      rawBody = False
      redirectCount = 10
      responseTimeout = ResponseTimeoutDefault
      requestVersion = HTTP/1.1
     }
      (ConnectionFailure Network.Socket.getAddrInfo (called with

addrFamily = AF_UNSPEC, addrSocketType = Stream, addrProtocol = 0,

     Error: processing vignette
'Ex-04-Webscraping-Online-Data-Files.Rmd' failed with diagnostics:
     pandoc document conversion failed with error 61

What's the recommended way for making this fail gracefully?  Again, I
am pointing to the images online.  I am aware of .Rbuildignore, but
using this would make the vignettes not hosted on the CRAN package
page.

Thanks in advance for your help.

This is Pandoc failing to bundle external resources from the final
Markdown file, not your R code.

>      pandoc document conversion failed with error 61

My psychic debugging powers tell me that this is the vignette you're
having problems with:
https://github.com/vinhdizzo/IRexamples/blob/main/vignettes/Ex-04-Webscraping-Online-Data-Files.Rmd

If you look at the vignette as it is on CRAN, you can see that the
images aren't actually loaded from live.staticflickr.com, but are
included as base64 PNG blobs in the HTML file. This is much less
efficient than a plain PNG file. I think that your package will become
smaller if you disable this bundling and include the original PNG files
in your package. You may be able to squeeze some more savings by using
pngcrush / optipng to compress the images further.

The parameter responsible for this base64 encoding is called
self_contained, which defaults to TRUE in the rmarkdown::html_document
format, which prettydoc::html_pretty inherits from. Set it to FALSE in
the YAML header of the vignette.

Note that some other scripts and CSS files may be loaded from external
sources if you do that. As a user, I would prefer this not to be the
case, but I don't know enough about rmarkdown to set your vignette up
to bundle everything except the images.

Hi Dewey,

Currently there are several packages on a subfolder for human inspection.
I don't think you can do anything else: sending this email might help
drawing attention from your reviewer to your package.
There might be some issues in the package that you'll need to address, try
to find them in advance or prepare a reply for them.

Probably the reviewer is busy with other non-CRAN related things. Or maybe
the review fell between emails.
After a couple of weeks you could try again sending an email to the
reviewer.

Best,

Llu?s

Thanks for the detailed investigation and analysis, Ivan. For now, I've
followed your suggestion and added the option `self_contained: false`. The
revised package is now on CRAN, and you are correct that css files are no
longer contained for the version sitting on CRAN, so the vignette is less
pretty looking. I'll investigate if there are any other workarounds.

Your assistance is much appreciated.

I am trying to update my CRAN package metap. When I ran a final check on

      compacted 'plotmetap.pdf' from 349Kb to 91Kb
   consider running tools::compactPDF(gs_quality = "ebook") on these files,
   or build the source package with --compact-vignettes=both

But I did use the option --compact-vignettes=both when I built the tarball.

I do have gs installed but not qpdf. I built the package under Windows 
if that is relevant.

Any suggestions?

Is the Ghostscript executable on the %PATH%? It might help to install a
newer version. It may also be informative to extract the vignette *.pdf
files from the source package tarball and run tools::compactPDF(pdfs,
gs_quality='ebook', verbose = TRUE) to see whether it breaks at any
point.

Dear Ivan

You must have psychic powers. After some digging I find that the copy 
installed by TexLive is hidden from other software so I need to install 
it again. I suppose while I am at it I should try installing qpdf.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Note: no function found corresponding to methods
 exports for show
Message-ID: <CABYZkg=KbFch1WsJN_E-nfrMfoNBNjX2rZyVpLpZgdY507eaAQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I recently submitted my first R package to CRAN, and I encountered a NOTE
during the checking process. The NOTE looks like this:

=============================================================
Flavor: r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-gcc, r-devel-windows-x86_64
Check: whether the namespace can be loaded with stated dependencies,
Result: NOTE
  Warning: no function found corresponding to methods exports from 'hmsr'
for: 'show'

  A namespace must be able to be loaded with just the base namespace
  loaded: otherwise if the namespace gets loaded by a saved object, the
  session will be unable to start.

  Probably some imports need to be declared in the NAMESPACE file.
=============================================================

I'm seeking help to understand and address this issue. show is defined like
this:

#' Show method for class "hms".#'#' @param object - hms s4 object#'#'
@return It returns the names of the slots and the classes associated
with the#' slots in the "hms" class. It prints call details.#'#'
@export#'#' @examples
#' f <- function(x) x
#' result <- hms(fitness = f, lower = -5, upper = 5)
#' show(result)
setMethod("show", "hms", function(object) {
  cat("An object of class \"hms\"\n")
  cat("\nCall:\n", deparse(object at call), "\n\n", sep = "")
  cat("Available slots:\n")
  print(methods::slotNames(object))})

And in the NAMESPACE there is a line that looks like this:

exportMethods(show)

I was investigating if the show is defined correctly and the GA package has
a very similar method:

setMethod("show", "ga",function(object)
 { cat("An object of class \"ga\"\n")
   cat("\nCall:\n", deparse(object at call), "\n\n",sep="")
   cat("Available slots:\n")
   print(slotNames(object))})

I could not reproduce this NOTE on my personal machine with Windows.
On Mac OS I have never experienced this NOTE.


Best regards
