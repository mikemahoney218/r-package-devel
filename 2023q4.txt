Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Problem with "compacting" pdf files.
Message-ID: <20231001211547.4c46512e@rolf-Latitude-E7470>


When I submitted an update of my Iso package a short time ago, it was
rejected as not passing the incoming checks automatically.  Explicitly,
I got a WARNING:

> * checking sizes of PDF files under 'inst/doc' ... WARNING
> 'gs+qpdf' made some significant size reductions:
>      compacted 'algorithm.pdf' from 394Kb to 99Kb
>   consider running tools::compactPDF(gs_quality = "ebook") on these
> files

I did as instructed and ran

    tools::compactPDF("./algorithm.pdf",gs_quality="ebook")

having started R in the inst/vignettes directory, which is where the
file algorithm.pdf is to be found.

According to "ls -l" the size of algorithm.pdf was about 109 Kb. before
I ran compactPDF() and about 90 Kb. afterward.

I do not understand:

    * the reference to inst/doc (there is no such directory)
    * where the sizes 349 Kb and 99 Kb come from
    * what I have to do to get Iso to pass the required checks

The email that I received from CRAN (under the return address
ligges at statistik.tu-dortmund.de) said:

> If you are not sure how to fix the problems shown, please ask for
> help on the R-package-devel mailing list:

Consequently I am asking! Can anyone set me on the path to
enlightenment?  Thanks.

cheers,

When you run R CMD build in order to produce a new Iso-*.tar.gz, R runs
Sweave and pdflatex on vignettes/algorithm.Rnw in order to produce
inst/doc/algorithm.pdf inside the resulting tarball (but not the
original source tree on your computer).

Does it help to run R CMD build --compact-vignettes=both? This should
let R run tools::compactPDF on inst/doc/algorithm.pdf it generates
before placing it inside the package tarball.

I think that R doesn't know anything about files under inst/vignettes
in the source tree.

Thanks Ivan.  That may well be the key.  When I unpacked the tarball
created without the --compact-vignettes=both flag, I found that
inst/doc/algorithm.pdf had size 403 Kb, whereas with that flag set
it had size 108 Kb.

I'll re-submit now and see what happens.

I *really* think that the instructions from CRAN could have been
clearer!  Without your guidance I'd have been at a total loss.

cheers,

Rolf

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] DESCRIPTION file Imports of base R packages
Message-ID: <CAOO9MKUOviqNjYxC9JgHJOmTqwFUOgLeUWqTMCTbEPw3vQPWXg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I noticed some packages define Imports in DESCRIPTION file listing base R
packages like methods, utils, etc.

My question is that if it is necessary to list those* dependencies in
DESCRIPTION file, or is it enough to have them listed in NAMESPACE file?

* by "those" I mean packages listed by:

in tools:::.get_standard_package_names()$base

You do *not* have to declare base-R packages as dependencies in the
DESCRIPTION file.  'R CMD check' and 'R CMD check --as-cran' will not
complain about them.

I can't speak for others, but, I choose to declare all(*) my base-R
package dependencies in my DESCRIPTION files for a reason.  This makes
it explicit what packages my package rely on, including which of the
base-R packages.  For instance, it's nice to be able to tell when the
'parallel' or 'tcltk' package is used from the DESCRIPTION file (and
the online CRAN package page, if on CRAN).

(*) The exception is the 'base' package, because that is such a
fundamental package in R and is always loaded.  The other base-R
packages are theoretically optional when it comes to running R, e.g.

$ R_ENABLE_JIT=0 Rscript --vanilla --default-packages=base -e
"loadedNamespaces()"
[1] "base"
