Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Problem with "compacting" pdf files.
Message-ID: <20231001211547.4c46512e@rolf-Latitude-E7470>


When I submitted an update of my Iso package a short time ago, it was
rejected as not passing the incoming checks automatically.  Explicitly,
I got a WARNING:

> * checking sizes of PDF files under 'inst/doc' ... WARNING
> 'gs+qpdf' made some significant size reductions:
>      compacted 'algorithm.pdf' from 394Kb to 99Kb
>   consider running tools::compactPDF(gs_quality = "ebook") on these
> files

I did as instructed and ran

    tools::compactPDF("./algorithm.pdf",gs_quality="ebook")

having started R in the inst/vignettes directory, which is where the
file algorithm.pdf is to be found.

According to "ls -l" the size of algorithm.pdf was about 109 Kb. before
I ran compactPDF() and about 90 Kb. afterward.

I do not understand:

    * the reference to inst/doc (there is no such directory)
    * where the sizes 349 Kb and 99 Kb come from
    * what I have to do to get Iso to pass the required checks

The email that I received from CRAN (under the return address
ligges at statistik.tu-dortmund.de) said:

> If you are not sure how to fix the problems shown, please ask for

Consequently I am asking! Can anyone set me on the path to
enlightenment?  Thanks.

When you run R CMD build in order to produce a new Iso-*.tar.gz, R runs
Sweave and pdflatex on vignettes/algorithm.Rnw in order to produce
inst/doc/algorithm.pdf inside the resulting tarball (but not the
original source tree on your computer).

Does it help to run R CMD build --compact-vignettes=both? This should
let R run tools::compactPDF on inst/doc/algorithm.pdf it generates
before placing it inside the package tarball.

I think that R doesn't know anything about files under inst/vignettes
in the source tree.

Thanks Ivan.  That may well be the key.  When I unpacked the tarball
created without the --compact-vignettes=both flag, I found that
inst/doc/algorithm.pdf had size 403 Kb, whereas with that flag set
it had size 108 Kb.

I'll re-submit now and see what happens.

I *really* think that the instructions from CRAN could have been
clearer!  Without your guidance I'd have been at a total loss.

cheers,

Rolf

You do *not* have to declare base-R packages as dependencies in the
DESCRIPTION file.  'R CMD check' and 'R CMD check --as-cran' will not
complain about them.

I can't speak for others, but, I choose to declare all(*) my base-R
package dependencies in my DESCRIPTION files for a reason.  This makes
it explicit what packages my package rely on, including which of the
base-R packages.  For instance, it's nice to be able to tell when the
'parallel' or 'tcltk' package is used from the DESCRIPTION file (and
the online CRAN package page, if on CRAN).

(*) The exception is the 'base' package, because that is such a
fundamental package in R and is always loaded.  The other base-R
packages are theoretically optional when it comes to running R, e.g.

$ R_ENABLE_JIT=0 Rscript --vanilla --default-packages=base -e
"loadedNamespaces()"
[1] "base"

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Rmarkdown package vignette that reference online
 images: how to fail gracefully?
Message-ID: <CA+2Dmwj1LG6+gLTLG1aA7FGourHEQ39r4qPOPBq6SNzSv4v2Vw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear members of R-package-devel,

CRAN has the following policy: Packages which use Internet resources
should fail gracefully with an informative message if the resource is
not available or has changed (and not give a check warning nor error).

I have a CRAN-accepted package with vignettes that use Rmarkdown. One
of the vignettes involves a lot of images, so rather than embed the
raw images in the vignette, I reference the images on Flickr (to keep
the package size small enough to be hosted on CRAN). Every half year
or so, I'll get a message from CRAN maintainers that the package is
not failing gracefully on one of their servers due to their build and
testing processes.  The error message looks as follows:

Could not fetch
https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52281215570_5f9cc90a12_o.png
     HttpExceptionRequest Request {
      host = "live.staticflickr.com"
      port = 443
      secure = True
      requestHeaders = []
      path = "/65535/52281215570_5f9cc90a12_o.png"
      queryString = ""
      method = "GET"
      proxy = Nothing
      rawBody = False
      redirectCount = 10
      responseTimeout = ResponseTimeoutDefault
      requestVersion = HTTP/1.1
     }
      (ConnectionFailure Network.Socket.getAddrInfo (called with

addrFamily = AF_UNSPEC, addrSocketType = Stream, addrProtocol = 0,

     Error: processing vignette
'Ex-04-Webscraping-Online-Data-Files.Rmd' failed with diagnostics:
     pandoc document conversion failed with error 61

What's the recommended way for making this fail gracefully?  Again, I
am pointing to the images online.  I am aware of .Rbuildignore, but
using this would make the vignettes not hosted on the CRAN package
page.

Thanks in advance for your help.

This is Pandoc failing to bundle external resources from the final
Markdown file, not your R code.

>      pandoc document conversion failed with error 61

My psychic debugging powers tell me that this is the vignette you're
having problems with:
https://github.com/vinhdizzo/IRexamples/blob/main/vignettes/Ex-04-Webscraping-Online-Data-Files.Rmd

If you look at the vignette as it is on CRAN, you can see that the
images aren't actually loaded from live.staticflickr.com, but are
included as base64 PNG blobs in the HTML file. This is much less
efficient than a plain PNG file. I think that your package will become
smaller if you disable this bundling and include the original PNG files
in your package. You may be able to squeeze some more savings by using
pngcrush / optipng to compress the images further.

The parameter responsible for this base64 encoding is called
self_contained, which defaults to TRUE in the rmarkdown::html_document
format, which prettydoc::html_pretty inherits from. Set it to FALSE in
the YAML header of the vignette.

Note that some other scripts and CSS files may be loaded from external
sources if you do that. As a user, I would prefer this not to be the
case, but I don't know enough about rmarkdown to set your vignette up
to bundle everything except the images.

Hi Dewey,

Currently there are several packages on a subfolder for human inspection.
I don't think you can do anything else: sending this email might help
drawing attention from your reviewer to your package.
There might be some issues in the package that you'll need to address, try
to find them in advance or prepare a reply for them.

Probably the reviewer is busy with other non-CRAN related things. Or maybe
the review fell between emails.
After a couple of weeks you could try again sending an email to the
reviewer.

Best,

Llu?s

Thanks for the detailed investigation and analysis, Ivan. For now, I've
followed your suggestion and added the option `self_contained: false`. The
revised package is now on CRAN, and you are correct that css files are no
longer contained for the version sitting on CRAN, so the vignette is less
pretty looking. I'll investigate if there are any other workarounds.

Your assistance is much appreciated.

I am trying to update my CRAN package metap. When I ran a final check on

   consider running tools::compactPDF(gs_quality = "ebook") on these files,
   or build the source package with --compact-vignettes=both

But I did use the option --compact-vignettes=both when I built the tarball.

I do have gs installed but not qpdf. I built the package under Windows 
if that is relevant.

Any suggestions?

Is the Ghostscript executable on the %PATH%? It might help to install a
newer version. It may also be informative to extract the vignette *.pdf
files from the source package tarball and run tools::compactPDF(pdfs,
gs_quality='ebook', verbose = TRUE) to see whether it breaks at any
point.

Dear Ivan

You must have psychic powers. After some digging I find that the copy 
installed by TexLive is hidden from other software so I need to install 
it again. I suppose while I am at it I should try installing qpdf.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Note: no function found corresponding to methods
 exports for show
Message-ID: <CABYZkg=KbFch1WsJN_E-nfrMfoNBNjX2rZyVpLpZgdY507eaAQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I recently submitted my first R package to CRAN, and I encountered a NOTE
during the checking process. The NOTE looks like this:

=============================================================
Flavor: r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-gcc, r-devel-windows-x86_64
Check: whether the namespace can be loaded with stated dependencies,
Result: NOTE
  Warning: no function found corresponding to methods exports from 'hmsr'
for: 'show'

  A namespace must be able to be loaded with just the base namespace
  loaded: otherwise if the namespace gets loaded by a saved object, the
  session will be unable to start.

  Probably some imports need to be declared in the NAMESPACE file.
=============================================================

I'm seeking help to understand and address this issue. show is defined like
this:

#' Show method for class "hms".#'#' @param object - hms s4 object#'#'
@return It returns the names of the slots and the classes associated
with the#' slots in the "hms" class. It prints call details.#'#'
@export#'#' @examples
#' f <- function(x) x
#' result <- hms(fitness = f, lower = -5, upper = 5)
#' show(result)
setMethod("show", "hms", function(object) {
  cat("An object of class \"hms\"\n")
  cat("\nCall:\n", deparse(object at call), "\n\n", sep = "")
  cat("Available slots:\n")
  print(methods::slotNames(object))})

And in the NAMESPACE there is a line that looks like this:

exportMethods(show)

I was investigating if the show is defined correctly and the GA package has
a very similar method:

setMethod("show", "ga",function(object)
 { cat("An object of class \"ga\"\n")
   cat("\nCall:\n", deparse(object at call), "\n\n",sep="")
   cat("Available slots:\n")
   print(slotNames(object))})

I could not reproduce this NOTE on my personal machine with Windows.
On Mac OS I have never experienced this NOTE.


Best regards

Wojciech Achtelik

Following on from Ivan's advice I have now installed qpdf and Ghostview. 
I have checked that they are both on my path by typing their name at the 
command line and verifying they open. I then built the package with the 
--compress-vignettes=both and then checked it with --as-cran I still get 
a complaint that it needs qpdf to check compression.

I notice that in the Writing R Extensions manual in section 1.6.1 it states
"The full path to the qpdf command can be supplied as environment 
variable R_QPDF ..."

Is that a typo for "must be supplied"? If it is where can I find the 
answers to questions about how R accepts Windows paths? Do I need to 
enclose parts of names containing spaces in "" signs? Does it mean the 
path up to, in this case, bin or must I include qpdf.exe after it?

I assume I do not need to do anything special to get it to find Ghostscript?

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] CXX_VISIBILITY on macOS
Message-ID: <1MbirE-1rRfHw1i7q-00dG2U@mail.gmx.net>

Dear developers and CRAN people,

I get some linker warnings on the macOS build server,

ld: warning: direct access in function '?' from file '?' to global weak symbol '?' from file '?' means the weak symbol cannot be overridden at runtime. This was likely caused by different translation units being compiled with different visibility settings.

Writing R Extensions (Section 6.16) says that visibility attributes are not supported on macOS nor Windows. If I add $(CXX_VISIBILITY) to PKG_CXXFLAGS, the warnings are still there, and I can see from the compiler log that the flags do not have any effect on macOS. However, if I add -fvisibility=hidden to PKG_CXXFLAGS, the warnings disappear (but I get a reminder from R CMD check that -fvisibility=hidden is not portable). I am wondering if $(CXX_VISIBILITY) could be supported on macOS.

Best wishes,

Matthias

This is the build log of the package: https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-release-macos-arm64/rswipl-00install.html

Matthias,

this has nothing to do with R, but rather your code. You have the wrong order of headers: the SWI headers mess up visibility macros, so you have to include them *after* Rcpp.h.

Cheers,
Simon

Sounds like your NAMESPACE is missing importFrom(methods, show) ... ?
I'm not sure why you could not reproduce the problem locally, given that
check uses _R_CHECK_CODE_USAGE_WITH_ONLY_BASE_ATTACHED_=true by default.
But it is hard to say anything without a link to the package sources ...

Franz,

it means that the author(s) have abandoned the package: as the note says it was failing checks and the authors have not fixed the problems so it has been removed from CRAN (more than a year ago).

Cheers,
Simon

While running R, does Sys.which('qpdf') return the path to qpdf.exe?
Does Sys.getenv('PATH') match your expectations?

Well, R tries to resolve the path to qpdf.exe using Sys.which(), so it
must work if it's on the %PATH%, but if all else fails, setting this
environment variable should help.

> If it is where can I find the answers to questions about how R

It always depends on how the final command line is built by a
particular function, but it should work by taking plain file paths
without any escaping and quotation. The directory separators shouldn't
matter either.

(tools::compactPDF uses system2(), so it quotes the path to the
executable by itself.)

> Does it mean the path up to, in this case, bin or must I include

It must be the full path to the executable, including the final
qpdf.exe.

> I assume I do not need to do anything special to get it to find
> Ghostscript?

tools::compactPDF() expects gswin64c.exe or gswin32c.exe on the PATH.
If it's not there, R_GSCMD must be set to the full path to the
executable. Judging by the NOTE you've received, it's Ghostscript that
performed most of the compaction in your case.

Reading tools:::.check_packages I see that this environment variable is
not relevant to this particular test.  Still, do import generic functions
for which you define methods, from all packages != "base".

Dear Ivan (and list)

Using Ivan's advice I traced the problem to a difference of opinio 
between Microsoft and R about paht names. I had mistakenly enclosed 
parts of the names in "" which was fine for MS but not R. Sys.which() 
was my saviour here.

Many thanks to Ivan for broadening my knowledge of useful functions like 
Sys.which().

R could care less about what is in PATH... there is however a difference between Windows parsing PATH and how CMD lets you quote things interactively.

The whole point of PATH is to let you or R provide simple program names like qpdf without knowing where they are... Windows takes over and looks up where the program actually is based on the contents of PATH. How you get things into that environment variable can vary depending on which software you are using (CMD and R are two possible options), but the actual content is handled by the operating system (which is why PATH on Linux is formatted differently than PATH on Windows).

Hi,

I am developing an R package where I need to save Raster file with .tif extension to the tempdir(). I am using terra::writeRaster for the same. While it works through R CMD check in mac, it is failing in R hub builder.
Snippet ?V
.saverast <- function(typ, rast, outdir) {

  if (is.null(outdir) || length(outdir) == 0) {
    outdir <- tempdir()
  }

  # Save the plot as a raster file
  fp <- file.path(outdir, paste("plots", "/",
                                typ, "_",
                                stringr::str_replace_all(Sys.time(), "[^a-zA-Z0-9]", ""),
                                ".tif", sep = ""))

  if (!dir.exists(fp)) {

Are you intentionally running dir.exists on _file_names?
dir.exists("existing_folder/imaginary.file") shows FALSE, somwhat counterintuitively.
You might want to wrap the filenames in dirname...

Outdir is either a directory like getwd(), tempdir() etc or empty/null. If it is empty/null, then I set it to tempdir().

if (is.null(outdir) || length(outdir) == 0) {
    outdir <- tempdir()
}
I am not sure how to debug when running it in Rbuilder. But you can look at results here - https://builder.r-hub.io/status/geohabnet_1.0.0.tar.gz-a2eaa40ccf1d026bbebf5077bfb482d5

That doesn't answer the question, and the link you provided doesn't 
answer it either, as far as I can see.  In the test and the vignette 
that generated the errors, something specific was passed as outdir.  But 
what? If it was getwd(), that's bound to fail -- you don't have 
permission to write there.  tempdir() should have worked, but Berry 
pointed out some other things that might be problems.

You wrote

# create the plots directory if it does not exist

but then created a directory named outdir/plots/typ_Sys.time.tif

You need to rewrite the code like:

plotsdir <- file.path(outdir, "plots")
fp <- file.path(plotsdir,  paste(typ, "_",
    stringr::str_replace_all(Sys.time(), "[^a-zA-Z0-9]", ""),
                                ".tif", sep = ""))
# Create the "plots" directory if it doesn't exist
  if (!dir.exists(plotsdir)) {
    dir.create(plotsdir, recursive = TRUE)
  }

Hi,

This works. I think this is also an implementation of what Berry and Duncan suggested earlier. Thanks.

Message-ID: <CAAhN7=pjA=3CRfCW8i3P9-QtGqAo0pW0B5QKTA7M-PE9ZcGEwQ@mail.gmail.com>

R-under-devel via winbuilder is giving me the following note, for the
ctsem package. I have no idea what it refers to -- I chased down the
few instances of using the break function in my package and reworked
the code to get rid of them, but didn't help. Any clues, or idea why
this note is so uninformative, would be welcome...

This looks like an error coming from a JavaScript engine or from a
JavaScript-derived language:

https://github.com/blld/libecc/blob/88877a46ba9b0a47567aa999a4380b9e793783a8/src/main.c#L714
https://github.com/ynezz/openwrt-ucode/blob/5163867269fc04fa01ec5e9f8df3384c933339f2/compiler.c#L2930https://github.com/Bobris/Njsast/blob/930f59a9694432580a7b1367680c56672cfe4cd2/Njsast/Compress/LoopControlFinderTreeWalker.cs#L34

(Most modern implementations say "_unlabeled_ break must be inside loop
or switch", but this may come from an older version.)

This seems to have nothing to do with Stan either; at the very least I
cannot find this exact error message in https://github.com/stan-dev.
When R complains about a wrongly placed `break`, it also looks
differently:

break
# Error: no loop for break/next, jumping to top level

An infrastructure hiccup on Win-Builder?

Message-ID: <AS4P195MB1430B755EEFBFE242B1C6EFCBECCA@AS4P195MB1430.EURP195.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Dear all,

I'm trying to publish an R package to CRAN. Their checks come back with 2 NOTES. The first one is saying that the package is a new submission, and the second one is that there is a subdirectory with a package inside my package. Both notes are correct. I have explained in my submission comments that this is indeed a new submission. I also gave the following explanation for the second note in my submission comments: "There is 1 NOTE given by the R CMD check results. This is due to the fact that I have placed fake libraries with fake packages inside the "inst/tinytest/" folder. This was necessary to test the various import-system related functions in my package. As stated, these are fake packages, and only contain trivial functions of no consequence. These fake libraries with fake packages ONLY exist because it is necessary for proper and extensive unit testing, that is all."

They asked me to fix these notes a few days ago. I replied (politely) repeating my comments a few days ago. I have not heard back from CRAN since. I am assuming that I am missing something, but CRAN won't explain what exactly I am missing.

Here are the NOTES:

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Question regarding CRAN submission with notes
In-Reply-To: <AS4P195MB1430B755EEFBFE242B1C6EFCBECCA@AS4P195MB1430.EURP195.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

The note says it contains "an installed version" of the package, 
presumably referring to your test package.

I think you shouldn't do that.  For a trivial package it might be true 
that the installed version is the same on all systems, but it won't 
continue to be as the installation code evolves.

What you could try is to include files that would let you install the 
test package into a library under tempdir().  Your tests would start by 
installing the test package there, then run the tests, then clean up 
afterwards.

It's possible the tests will still complain about that, in which case 
I'd go one step further back, and write a function to create the source 
package, rather than including it.  For example, have a file 
DESCRIPTION.txt which your test renames to DESCRIPTION, etc.

The first one is saying that the package is a new submission, and the second one is that there is a subdirectory with a package inside my package. Both notes are correct. I have explained in my submission comments that this is indeed a new submission. I also gave the following explanation for the second note in my submission comments: "There is 1 NOTE given by the R CMD check results. This is due to the fact that I have placed fake libraries with fake packages inside the "inst/tinytest/" folder. This was necessary to test the various import-system related functions in my package. As stated, these are fake packages, and only contain trivial functions of no consequence. These fake libraries with fake packages ONLY exist because it is necessary for proper and extensive unit testing, that is all."

Update: I submitted a new version of the package, but it did not fix the
issue. The package has now been archived and I do not have access to the
error log output anymore from r-devel-linux-x86_64-fedora-clang.

I did reproduce CRAN's configuration in a VM using the information provided
by CRAN for r-devel-linux-x86_64-fedora-clang. I still cannot reproduce the
error and at this point I believe that there is a chance that CRAN's
machine is misconfigured.

The specific error happens after rbedrock has been compiled and linked
successfully. The specific error is that the symbol
_ZNSt3__122__libcpp_verbose_abortEPKcz cannot be found when rbedrock.so is
loaded.This symbol was introduced into libc++ in Clang 15.0. What I believe
to be happening to cause the error is that Clang++ 17 is adding a reference
to this symbol when compiling and linking rbedrock.so but the dynamic
linker is loading an older version of libc++.so when trying to load
rbedrock.so and the symbol is not found.

If this is the cause, then I think that the CRAN machine needs to configure
the dynamic linker to use the Clang++ 17 libc++.so, or add the proper
command line options to R's config variables.

It's possible that the CRAN's r-devel-linux-x86_64-fedora-clang machine is
fine and I've missed something, and I would be happy if someone could help
me figure out what it is.

Also, a new issue cropped up when 0.3.1 was tested on the
r-oldrel-macos-x86_64 machine. /usr/bin/ar seems to have failed to produce
an archive. The other Mac versions did fine, so I'm not sure if this is a
random error or something related to my package. The error log is here:
https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-oldrel-macos-x86_64/rbedrock-00install.html

If anyone can help me resolve this, I'd appreciate it.

Reed,

please contact CRAN - this list can only help with general developer's questions, not specific issues with a particular CRAN setup - only the corresponding member of CRAN running the setup can help. I don't see anything obvious - we can see that it's a mismatch of run-times between the cmake build and the R linking, but from the package alone it's not clear to me why.

Cheers,
Simon

The specific error is that the symbol _ZNSt3__122__libcpp_verbose_abortEPKcz cannot be found when rbedrock.so is loaded.This symbol was introduced into libc++ in Clang 15.0. What I believe to be happening to cause the error is that Clang++ 17 is adding a reference to this symbol when compiling and linking rbedrock.so but the dynamic linker is loading an older version of libc++.so when trying to load rbedrock.so and the symbol is not found.

Okay, I'll reach out to the CRAN team shortly.

I wanted to run it by the group here first because my interactions with the
CRAN team haven't always been positive and I need to make sure that I'm not
missing something "obvious".

well..  one thing not enough obvious:  Simon Urbanek _is_
part of the CRAN team (*).   So at least you had a positive
interaction with "them", now ! ;-)

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Question regarding listing base and recommended
 packages programmatically and efficiently
Message-ID: <AS4P195MB1430D1753ED9AB1C34FDDD7DBED3A@AS4P195MB1430.EURP195.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Dear all,

In my R package that I'm developing, I use `installed.packages(priority = "base")` to programmatically get all core/base R packages (i.e. base, stats, etc.). And similarly, I use installed.packages(priority = "recommended")?` to programmatically get the recommended R packages (i.e. mgcv, lattice, etc.).

However, CRAN has requested to not use `installed.packages()`, as it is slow. I fully get and agree with that assesment. I used installed.packages()?` anyway because I could not find a better, fool-proof alternative.

Nonetheless, I was asked to change this code for optimalisation. So I would like to ask: how do I programmatically get all base/core R packages safely and efficiently, but without using `installed.packages()`? And the same question for recommended R packages. I have of course Googled it, and looked at R's documentation (though R's documentation is large, so it's easy to miss something); no solution found. So if any of you has a smart idea: I'm all ears.

Thank you in advance.

Kind regards,

Tony.

Dear Tony,

Much will depend on what information you need from the output of
installed.packages()?

It would be much faster (but slightly less reliable) to use 
list.files(.libPaths()) to get the names of all installed packages, and 
then filter them to the known list of base and recommended packages, 
which changes very rarely.

So apparently there is a corrupted file in the current Stanheaders, 
which is hopefully fixed soon...

Maybe something like this:

     > body(isRecommendedPkg)[[c(3L, 3L)]] <- "recommended"
     > installed <- unique(list.files(.libPaths()))

     [11] "nlme"       "nnet"       "rpart"      "spatial"    "survival"

where in your package you would define isRecommendedPkg "manually".

Another (but quite undocumented and so maybe not "recommended" :-))
possibility is this:

     > mk <- file.path(R.home("share"), "make", "vars.mk")
     > pp <- sub("^.*= +", "", grep("^R_PKGS_RECOMMENDED", readLines(mk), value

     [11] "nlme"       "nnet"       "rpart"      "spatial"    "survival"

I grepped around and did not find variables in any base namespace containing
the names of these packages.  It wouldn't be too hard to define such variables
when R is configured/built, but maybe there are "reasons" to not do that ... ?

tools:::.get_standard_package_names does that at package installation
time, but it's still not public API.

A call to installed.packages() may take a long while because it has to
list files in every library (some of which can be large and/or
network-mounted) and parse each Meta/package.rds file, but at least
list.files() is faster than that.

If I had to make a choice at this point, I would hard-code the list of
packages, but a better option may surface once we know what Tony needs
the package lists for.

Dear all,

My R package has yesterday been accepted by CRAN. I'm super happy about this, of course.
But when I look at the package's CRAN check results (see https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_tinycodet.html), I see that r-oldrel-macos-arm64 has latex errors.
I find it very odd that the package runs fine on all OS, except this particular one. And I don't see why latex errors would be OS-specific. (Btw: I actually checked my R package personally on Mac OS before giving to CRAN, and there were no errors then.)

As stated, my package is published, so it's not the end of the world. But I don't want certain people to be left out, so I would prefer to fix this particular error also. The latex errors are not very enlightening.

Can anyone please explain why these latex errors are there, and how I could fix them in the future?

Thank you in advance.

Kind regards,

Tony.

The difference is that the r-oldrel-windows-x86_64 checks are running
R-4.2.3, but r-oldrel-macos-arm64 are running R-4.2.0. I can reproduce
the issue with R-4.2.0, and it's in the s_regex help page. Here's the
relevant difference in the intermediate *.tex files:

 The \LinkA{\Rpercent{}s-\Rpercent{}}{.Rpcent.s.Rdash..Rpcent.} and \LinkA{\Rpercent{}s/\Rpercent{}}{.Rpcent.s/.Rpcent.} operators,
-as well as the string detection operators (\LinkA{\Rpercent{}s\textbraceleft{\textbraceright{}\textbraceright{}\Rpercent{}}{.Rpcent.s.Rlbrace..Rrbrace..Rpcent.}, \LinkA{\Rpercent{}s!\textbraceleft{\textbraceright{}\textbraceright{}\Rpercent{}}{.Rpcent.s!.Rlbrace..Rrbrace..Rpcent.}),
+as well as the string detection operators (\LinkA{\Rpercent{}s\{\}\Rpercent{}}{.Rpcent.s.Rlbrace..Rrbrace..Rpcent.}, \LinkA{\Rpercent{}s!\{\}\Rpercent{}}{.Rpcent.s!.Rlbrace..Rrbrace..Rpcent.}),
 perform pattern matching for some purpose,
 where the pattern is given on the right hand side. \\{}
 When a character vector or string is given on the right hand side,

This seems to correspond to R-devel revision 82224 made on 2022-04-20
that fixed the use of {} inside \code{\link{}}.

If you'd like a clean PDF manual build on R-4.2.0 and older, it may
help to give a different \alias to the %s{}% help page and use that
inside \link.

Based on 
https://cran-archive.r-project.org/web/checks/2022/2022-05-16_check_results_mlr3proba.html

   it looks like there were problems with the code (possibly harmless, 
but very unlikely to be exactly as intended) when R started throwing an 
error when vectors of length >1 were used with the && operator; this 
happened with R 4.3.0

https://cran-archive.r-project.org/web/checks/2022/2022-05-16_check_results_mlr3proba.html

       the form
\preformatted{    'length = 4' in coercion to 'logical(1)'}

   Since the errors weren't corrected, the package was archived.

Within R-core, we have somewhat discussed this, and a few
minutes ago I committed a "public API" version of the above,
called
   standard_package_names()

to R-devel (svn rev 85329), and hence probably in next year's
April release of R.

The above is another issue that we've wanted to improve, as some
of you are aware,  notably thinking about caching the result
.. there has been work on this during the R Sprint @ Warwick a
couple of weeks ago,

 ==> https://github.com/r-devel/r-project-sprint-2023/issues/78

involving smart people and promising proposals (my personal view).

Excellent. Will it be supported on all OSes?  Because, there's
currently a source code comment saying the current implementation
might not work on MS Windows:

## we cannot assume that file.path(R.home("share"), "make", "vars.mk")
## is installed, as it is not on Windows
standard_package_names <-
.get_standard_package_names <-
local({
    lines <- readLines(file.path(R.home("share"), "make", "vars.mk"))
    lines <- grep("^R_PKGS_[[:upper:]]+ *=", lines, value = TRUE)
    out <- strsplit(sub("^R_PKGS_[[:upper:]]+ *= *", "", lines), " +")

Well, it does work nowadays on Windows {just checked}.
So the comment should probably be removed.

That is normal. No action needed.

It usually flags proper nouns, not sure why it disikes invariance, but 
those are presumably fase positives which you could mention in the 
covering note.

Not sure about that one. Were you the original maintainer? If not did 
CRAN know you were taking over?

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Problem with "additional repository".
Message-ID: <20231016143457.4e9abf93@rolf-Latitude-E7470>


I have submitted a new package to CRAN, and this package has been
knocked back on the basis of a NOTE:

> * checking package dependencies ... NOTE
> Package suggested but not available for checking: 'ionChannelData'

This suggested package consists of data sets, the size of which is too
large to satisfy CRAN's constraints. I put this package in a repository
on github, from which it can be accessed by users.

My DESCRIPTION file contains the line:

> Additional_repositories: https://rolfturner.r-universe.dev

The given URL seems to work, in that users can indeed load the
ionChannelData package via the command

> install.packages("ionChannelData",repos="https://rolfturner.r-universe.dev")

I was under the impression that this was all that I needed to do.  The
CRAN checking process acknowledges the existence of the repository in
question:

> Suggests or Enhances not in mainstream repositories:
>   ionChannelData
> Availability using Additional_repositories specification:
>   ionChannelData   yes   https://rolfturner.r-universe.dev

So CRAN knows about this repository.  Why can it not make use of it?

What can/should I do to resolve this problem?

I guess I could simply *not* Suggest ionChannelData.  But what then, is
the point of the option of including an Additional_repositories field in
the DESCRIPTION file?

cheers,

Rolf Turner

The packages in additional repositories are not installed on the CRAN
checking machines. The NOTE is expected, but it's not a warning, so your
package should still be allowed to upload to CRAN. You should not remove
ionChannelData from Suggests because then the reference to that package in
your documentation will become a WARNING and your package will not be
uploaded to CRAN.

Is that web site set up as a repository?  My impression was that it 
needed to be, so people could do

   install.packages("ionChannelData", repos = 
"https://rolfturner.r-universe.dev")

You can use the "drat" package to set up a tiny repository quickly.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Suppressing long-running vignette code in CRAN
 submission
Message-ID: <55cac1c9-9f59-4ada-bdc5-273e12f83430@mcmaster.ca>

Dear list members,

I believe that this issue has been discussed previously, but I'm not 
sure that I have the solution right.

Georges Monette and I have developed a package that we intend to submit 
soon to CRAN which has a vignette including code that takes a long time 
to run. The sources for the package are available at 
<https://github.com/gmonette/cv>.

We figure that we have to suppress running the code the vignette when 
CRAN checks the package or the check time will be excessive.

The vignette is written as a .Rmd file to be compiled by knitr, 
producing an HTML vignette. The top of the .Rmd file looks like this:

------- snip -------

---
title: "Cross-validation of regression models"
author: "John Fox and Georges Monette"
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
package: cv
output:
   rmarkdown::html_vignette:
   fig_caption: yes
bibliography: ["cv.bib"]
csl: apa.csl
vignette: >
   %\VignetteIndexEntry{Cross-validation of regression models}
   %\VignetteEngine{knitr::rmarkdown}
   %\VignetteEncoding{UTF-8}
---

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
   collapse = TRUE,
   message = TRUE,
   warning = TRUE,
   fig.align = "center",
   fig.height = 6,
   fig.width = 7,
   fig.path = "fig/",
   dev = "png",
   comment = "#>",
   eval = nzchar(Sys.getenv("REBUILD_CV_VIGNETTES"))
)

### other irrelevant setup code not shown ###

```

------- snip -------

So (near the bottom), if the environment variable REBUILD_CV_VIGNETTES 
isn't empty, the code blocks in the vignette are evaluated, otherwise 
not. To build the tarball for the package to be submitted to CRAN, we 
will set REBUILD_CV_VIGNETTES to "true". That works as intended.

If we submit the tarball to CRAN, I believe that the package as 
distributed by CRAN will include the HTML vignette from our tarball, 
showing the evaluated code blocks, but when CRAN checks the package, 
these long-running code blocks will not be executed (because 
REBUILD_CV_VIGNETTES will not exist on the CRAN check machines).

My questions:

Is that correct?

If not, how can we ensure that the complete vignette is distributed by 
CRAN without causing an overly long CRAN check time?

In particular, we don't want CRAN to rebuild and distribute the 
vignette, because the resulting HTML file won't show the evaluated code.

Any assistance would be appreciated.

Thank you,
  John

Produce a PDF file yourself, then use the "as.is" feature of the R.rsp 
package.

Specifically, include this line in your DESCRIPTION file:
VignetteBuilder: R.rsp

Let's say the pdf file is called "myfile.pdf".? Create a file called 
"myfile.pdf.asis" that contains the vignette instructions. Put it in the 
vignette directory along with the PDF file. Mine looks like:

%\VignetteIndexEntry{PUT VIGNETTE TITLE HERE}
%\VignetteKeywords{PUT KEYWORDS HERE}
%\VignetteDepends{PACKAGE_NAME}
%\VignettePackage{PACKAGE_NAME}
%\VignetteEngine{R.rsp::asis}

I am not certain if this works for an HTML vignette, but I see no reason 
why it shouldn't.

Best,
 ? Kevin

Certainly there was more in the output that caused rejection as the 
stuff you describe below seems to be fine.
I do not know which package this refers to, so cannot easily look.

Best,

Hello John,

The way I've done this is I use the the global eval option to control
running the code. When it's set to TRUE it will run the code and save the
results as an RData file. So when I'm creating it locally I have eval=TRUE
in the options:

https://github.com/john-harrold/ubiquity/blob/bb0532915b63f02f701148e5ae097222fef50a2d/vignettes/Simulation.Rmd#L11

Then when I want to use the results I load them from a file:

https://github.com/john-harrold/ubiquity/blob/bb0532915b63f02f701148e5ae097222fef50a2d/vignettes/Simulation.Rmd#L101

Then before I submit to CRAN I set eval=FALSE in the setup at the top of
the vignette.

John

The packages that you imported are no longer available. As far as I
understand, rgeos, maptools, and a few other spatial related packages have
been archived and have been replaced with better alternatives.

Packages rgeos and maptools have been deprecated and archived on CRAN. You
should use sf or terra instead.

What was the full check result?

See the links at <https://r-spatial.github.io/evolution/>, including
<https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-geo/2023-October/029344.html>.

The archival message recommends the use of 'sf' or 'terra' instead of
'maptools' and 'rgeos'. I hope you'll be able to find the desired
functionality in these packages. People here and on R-SIG-Geo may be
able to give you more detailed instructions.

For completeness, that approach also works directly with Sweave. Described in

That said, I also used the approach described by John Harrold and cached

Hi, thanks to reply.?I know that the version 1.0.3 of cartogRaflow use rgeos maptools. Now the version cartogRaflow was archived on 16th October.?I've uploaded cartogRaflow version 1.0.4 with sf package.?
I've submitted yesterday the version 1.0.4 in CRAN and received 2 two error message because cartogRaflow is archived and use rgeos maptools in version 1.0.3?
My question is : how can put the version 1.0.4 in CRAN??
Thanks in advance?Sylvain?

Could you please show us the full R CMD check report e-mailed to you in
response to the CRAN submission?

A NOTE saying that the previous version had been archived is to be
expected. If it's all your package got, it will be manually reviewed
later and published.

I see you're using this logo in your README.md, not the vignette. I'm
not sure how CRAN's README.md renderer works and where it looks up the
images. Perhaps you do need to mention this file in .Rinstignore.

Many other packages seem to have given up and only use
externally-loaded images in their README.md (which is great for letting
third parties track the user every time they view a README).

Hello Dirk,

Thank you (and Kevin and John) for addressing my questions.

No one directly answered my first question, however, which was whether 
the approach that I suggested would work. I guess that the implication 
is that it won't, but it would be nice to confirm that before I try 
something else, specifically using R.rsp.

Best,
  John

Hello John,

It should work for the scenario where you as developer and CRAN's checks should both be happy. But there are other scenarios were it might not work.

For example, if a user wishes to build a local pkgdown site for your package, they would need to know to set that environment variable. I also see that you have pkgdown actions on the github repo but the eval option is commented out there

     # eval = nzchar(Sys.getenv("REBUILD_VIGNETTES"))

Even so, I don't see the vignette on the rendered site. The same thing I observed when I cloned the package, uncommented the 'eval' option, and run pkgdown. Of course you  could modify the pkgdown action to set the environment variable.
I don't know why pkgdown doesn't include the vignette 'cv' (it includes the other one). 

Also when the vignette is created without evaluating the code it would be useful to include a very visible message, explaining how to create the full one.

All in all, some of the solutions recommended by others seem preferable.

Georgi Boshnakov

Dear list members,

I believe that this issue has been discussed previously, but I'm not sure that I have the solution right.

Georges Monette and I have developed a package that we intend to submit soon to CRAN which has a vignette including code that takes a long time to run. The sources for the package are available at <https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://github.com/gmonette/cv__;!!PDiH4ENfjr2_Jw!BUIYcAjj16HHKVqI_3EssWXnTOQ1Sz95Vv_aF1ebj4qCCayUfxFKDASOpfkJhK4YTWTDJsbDgRVAHngMjRyqzrZC5Wsa$ [github[.]com]>.

We figure that we have to suppress running the code the vignette when CRAN checks the package or the check time will be excessive.

The vignette is written as a .Rmd file to be compiled by knitr, producing an HTML vignette. The top of the .Rmd file looks like this:

------- snip -------

---
title: "Cross-validation of regression models"
author: "John Fox and Georges Monette"
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
package: cv
output:
   rmarkdown::html_vignette:
   fig_caption: yes
bibliography: ["cv.bib"]
csl: apa.csl
vignette: >
   %\VignetteIndexEntry{Cross-validation of regression models}
   %\VignetteEngine{knitr::rmarkdown}
   %\VignetteEncoding{UTF-8}
---

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
   collapse = TRUE,
   message = TRUE,
   warning = TRUE,
   fig.align = "center",
   fig.height = 6,
   fig.width = 7,
   fig.path = "fig/",
   dev = "png",
   comment = "#>",
   eval = nzchar(Sys.getenv("REBUILD_CV_VIGNETTES"))
)

### other irrelevant setup code not shown ###

```

------- snip -------

So (near the bottom), if the environment variable REBUILD_CV_VIGNETTES isn't empty, the code blocks in the vignette are evaluated, otherwise not. To build the tarball for the package to be submitted to CRAN, we will set REBUILD_CV_VIGNETTES to "true". That works as intended.

If we submit the tarball to CRAN, I believe that the package as distributed by CRAN will include the HTML vignette from our tarball, showing the evaluated code blocks, but when CRAN checks the package, these long-running code blocks will not be executed (because REBUILD_CV_VIGNETTES will not exist on the CRAN check machines).

My questions:

Is that correct?

If not, how can we ensure that the complete vignette is distributed by CRAN without causing an overly long CRAN check time?

In particular, we don't want CRAN to rebuild and distribute the vignette, because the resulting HTML file won't show the evaluated code.

Any assistance would be appreciated.

Thank you,
  John

This seems to be about the eglhmm package. It seems to pass --as-cran
checks on my machine, but I know it's not the full set of checks
performed for new packages.

Thank you for addressing that question. I was concerned that CRAN would 
rebuild the vignette for the tarball that they distribute, which then 
would have no output.

In the interim, I implemented the approach using the R.rsp package 
suggested by Kevin and Dirk. It seems to work OK. A downside is that we 
have to maintain two versions of the package -- one for development, 
using knitr to build the HTML vignettes and the other using R.rsp with 
the HTML vignettes pre-built.

Yes, both vignettes are there. One is under "Get Started" (I believe 
because the vignette is in cv.html, with the same name as the package) 
and the other under "Articles."

Thanks for the suggestion. We'll think about this, though the process of 
creating the vignettes is already getting more complicated than I'd like.

Using R.rsp has the disadvantage of not including useful vignette 
sources in the tarball and thus installed package, but since it seems to 
be a well-used approach, I think we'll probably go with it.

Thanks again,
  John

I am a little remote here, both mentally and physically. What I might do here
in the case of your long-running vignette, and have done in about half a
dozen packages where I wanted 'certainty' and no surprises, is to render the
pdf vignette I want as I want them locally, ship them in the package as an
included file (sometimes from a subdirectory) and have a five-or-so line
Sweave .Rnw file include it. That works without hassles. Here is the Rnw I
use for package anytime

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{pdfpages}
%\VignetteIndexEntry{Introduction to anytime}
%\VignetteKeywords{anytime, date, datetime, conversion}
%\VignettePackage{anytime}
%\VignetteEncoding{UTF-8}

\begin{document}
\includepdf[pages=-, fitpaper=true]{anytime-intro.pdf}
\end{document}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

That is five lines of LaTeX code slurping in the pdf (per the blog post by
Mark). As I understand it R.rsp does something similar at the marginal cost
of an added dependency.

Now, as mentioned, you can also 'conditionally' conpute in a vignette and
choose if and when to use a data cache. I think that we show most of that in
the package described in the RJournal piece by Brooke and myself on drat for
data repositories. (We may be skipping the compute when the data is not
accessible. Loading a precomputed set is similar. I may be doing that in the
much older never quite finished gcbd package and its vignette.

Hope this helps, maybe more once I am back home.

Cheers, Dirk

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] CMD check: Examples vs DEPENDS pkg
Message-ID: <7ea981c3-faec-490f-841d-4ce8fce8e5cb@syonic.eu>

Dear List members,

Package Rpdf depends on package rgl. Multiple examples will call 
internally the rgl package to visualize the pdb molecule.

When performing the CMD check:
1) Is the rgl package loaded each time anew for any of those examples?

2) If this is the case:
Is it possible to load it only once per CMD check?

Sincerely,

Leonard

Hello Dirk,

Thank you for the additional information.

As you suggest, what you did to distribute pre-built PDF vignettes is 
quite similar to what R.rsp does, except that the latter also supports 
pre-built HTML vignettes, which is what I'd prefer to distribute. Since 
I apparently have that working now, we'll probably go with it unless we 
hit snags when the package is sent to CRAN.

While I appreciate the offer, it's probably not necessary for you to 
spend more time on this now.

Thanks again,
  John

Author of R.rsp here: It supports both static PDFs and static HTMLs, cf.

John,

the short answer is it won't work (it defeats the purpose of vignettes).

However, this sounds like a purely hypothetical question - CRAN policies allow long-running vignettes if they declared.

Cheers,
Simon

Dear Henrik,

I'd already read the R.rsp vignette to which you refer, and, as I said, 
confirmed that I can use R.rsp to implement static HTML vignettes for 
our package.

Thank you for the confirmation,
  John

Thank you for confirming that.

I assume that we'd declare the long-running vignette in our submission 
note to CRAN. Maybe that's better than pre-building the HTML vignettes 
in the package.

There's also the "BuildVignettes: false" field in DESCRIPTION, but its 
use is discouraged, and I don't think it allows you to ask CRAN to build 
some vignettes but not all.

Thanks, I wasn't aware of that. There are two vignettes, one of which is 
slow to build.

Given Simon's suggestion, we'll likely submit the package with a note 
about the long-running vignette, and if that proves problematic, we can 
use R.asp to pre-build the HTML vignettes.

Best,
  John

Not exactly. Everything is under our (i.e. package author) control, and when
we want to replace 'computed' values with cached values we can.

All this is somewhat of a charade. "Of course" we want vignettes to run
tests. But then we don't want to fall over random missing .sty files or fonts
(macOS machines have been less forgiving than others), not to mention compile
time.

So for simplicity I often pre-make pdf vignettes that get included in other
latex code as source. Works great, never fails, CRAN never complained --
which is somewhat contrary to your statement.

It is effectively the same with tests. We all want maximum test surfaces. But
when tests fail, or when they run too long, or [insert many other reasons
here] so many packages run tests conditionally.  Such is life.

Dirk

Dirk,

I think you misread the email - John was was asking specifically about his approach to use REBUILD_CV_VIGNETTES without any caching since that was the original question which no one answered in the thread - and that was what I was answering. The alternative approaches were already discussed to death so I didn't comment on those.

Cheers,
Simon

I ask myself the question: Who is the vignette for?  It does server two
purposes. One is testing but primarily it's for the users to learn how to
use a package. I think the testing is secondary, and if it slows down
installation or general usability I'd sacrifice the testing. If it's that
important, then the tests can be added explicitly in tests/.

And if the vignette claims to help the users, but contains errors?  Then 
it's not very helpful at all.  That's what the testing is there to detect.

Dear John,

Unless I'm mistaken, the *installation* time of the package isn't really 
at issue. If a user installs a package from a tarball provided by CRAN, 
the vignettes aren't normally rebuilt.

Best,
  John

Typically it is loaded once for the examples, once for each test file 
and once for each vignette that uses it.

It was 0.0-20 that had another issue now explained privately. 0.0-21 
passes cleanly.

Please pardon me if I suggest something unrelated below. Many experts
have made suggestions that I would also like to consider because I
also have a similar issue with some packages.

This is an approach I found, for Rmarkdown vignettes:

https://www.kloppenborg.ca/2021/06/long-running-vignettes/

This is similar to some of the suggestions. The vignette is rendered
locally. It uses the trick that, If we render the vignette by calling
knitr::knit() directly, the extension of the source file does not
matter. The output, although with the extension ".Rmd", actually
contains the results of the code, in chunks starting with "```r", not
"```{r}".

When this pre-buiult .Rmd file is built again, it will just convert
the file to an HTML file, with no need to rerun the code.

The method uses an extension for the source Rmd file (".orig" in the
post) to make sure the "real" source files are ignored when building
the vignettes.

Perhaps this is also a feasible solution for long running vignettes?

Regards,
Shu Fai

Dear Shu Fai,

This approach is certainly relevant, and I think it is slightly better 
than using R.rsp. My preference is still to include the original .Rmd 
file along with a note to CRAN about the long-running vignette.

Thank you,
  John

I am not sure who is the appropriate person to contact,  but thought I would try here since WInbuilder is a big help in package testing.  Winbuilder appears to be down at the moment.

Thanks,

Dear Roy

When I just checked using the winbuilder_queue function from the foghorn 
package it seemed to respond and had one package in the queue. Not sure 
that is definitive evicence.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Switch between \dontrun{  } and \donttest{  }.
Message-ID: <20231020131701.7f354741@rolf-Latitude-E7470>


In a package that I maintain, there are examples, in the *.Rd files,
that take an excruciatingly long time to run.  This makes package
checking extremely tedious.  There is no question of errors being
thrown from these examples, they are simply time consuming.  (The check
is being run to look for possible errors elsewhere.)

I therefore would like to wrap these examples in \dontrun{ }.

However when the package is submitted to CRAN, it is expedient to wrap
the examples in \donttest{ } rather than \dontrun{ }.

I would therefore like to find a means of effecting the following
logical structure:

    if(package is being checked by CRAN) {
        Use \donttest{ }
    } else {
        Use \dontrun{ }
    }

Is there a reasonably straightforward means of detecting whether
the package is being checked by CRAN, and thereby setting up such a
logical structure? Perhaps based on environment variables?

Can anyone give me any guidance?  Thanks.

cheers,

Rolf Turner

Message-ID: <PAXPR05MB8650BE166314CEAA80059BBEF8D4A@PAXPR05MB8650.eurprd05.prod.outlook.com>

Hi,

I am having difficulties in getting the latest version of the bssm (https://github.com/helske/bssm) package to CRAN, as the pretest issues a NOTE that the package uses too many cores in some of the examples ("Examples with CPU time > 2.5 times elapsed time"). I've seen plenty of discussion about this issue in relation to the data.table package, but bssm does not use it. Also, while bssm uses OpenMP in some functions, these are not called in the example in question (?exchange), and by default the number of threads in the parallelisable functions is set to 1.

But I just realised that bssm uses Armadillo via RcppArmadillo, which uses OpenMP by default for some elementwise operations. So, I wonder if that could be the culprit? However, I would think that in such case there would be many other packages with RcppArmadillo encountering the same CRAN issues. Has anyone experienced this with their packages which use RcppArmadillo but not data.table, or can say whether my guess is correct? I haven't been able to reproduce the issue myself on r-hub or my own linux, so I can't really test whether setting #define ARMA_DONT_USE_OPENMP helps.

Best,
Jouni

I think the method used by the testthat package is best:  assume it is 
being run by CRAN, unless an environment variable named NOT_CRAN is set 
to "true" (or some string like that).  Then set the environment variable 
at home, where you know you are not on CRAN.

You have some options to control OpenMP.

There is an environment variable (OMP_THREAD_LIMIT), and there is an CRAN
add-on package (RhpcBLASctl) which, if memory serves, also sets this. Looking
at the Armadillo documentation we see another variable (ARMA_OPENMP_THREADS).

I really think CRAN made a mistake here pushing this down on all package
maintainers.  It is too much work, some will get frustrated, some will get it
wrong and I fear in aggregate we end up with less performant software (as
some will 'cave in' and hard-wire single threaded computes).

I wasn't able to reproduce the NOTE either, despite manually setting

_R_CHECK_EXAMPLE_TIMING_CPU_TO_ELAPSED_THRESHOLD=2 before running R CMD
check, but I think I can see the code using OpenMP. Here's what I did:

0. Temporarily lower the system protections against capturing
performance traces of potentially sensitive parts:

echo -1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid

(Set it back to 3 after you're done.)

1. Run the following command with the development version of the
package installed:

env OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 \
 perf record --call-graph drawf,4096 \
 R -e 'library(bssm); system.time(replicate(100, example(exchange)))'

OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 will prevent OpenBLAS from spawning worker
threads if you have it installed. (A different BLAS may need different
environment variables.)

2. Run `perf report` and browse collected call stack information.

The call stacks are hard to navigate, but I think they are not pointing
towards Armadillo. At least, setting ARMA_OPENMP_THREADS=1 doesn't
help, but setting OMP_THREAD_LIMIT=1 does.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Issue of itemize in man file
Message-ID: <5be6435c-56ab-4742-a31c-e7a86ae23aed@gmail.com>

I'm doing a major update of the optimx package and things were going relatively
smoothly until this weekend when files that have passed win-builder gave NOTEs
on r-devel for several manual (.Rd) files.
The NOTE is of the form

> * checking Rd files ... NOTE
> checkRd: (-1) fnchk.Rd:40-41: Lost braces in \itemize; \value handles \item{}{} directly
> checkRd: (-1) fnchk.Rd:43: Lost braces in \itemize; \value handles \item{}{} directly
> checkRd: (-1) fnchk.Rd:45: Lost braces in \itemize; \value handles \item{}{} directly


The source of this looks like

   \item{msg}{A text string giving information about the result of the function check: Messages and
     the corresponding values of \code{excode} are:
       \itemize{
         \item{fnchk OK;}{ \code{excode} = 0;
                        \code{infeasible} = FALSE}
         \item{Function returns INADMISSIBLE;}
                     { \code{excode} = -1; \code{infeasible} = TRUE}
      ...
     }

I've not seen this before, nor does a search give any hits.

Does anyone have any ideas? Or is this a glitch in r-devel as things are tried out.?

I don't get the NOTE on win-builder R-release nor on local R CMD check. Note that the
\itemize is to give a second-level list i.e., for expanding output of one of the
\value objects returned, namely the return codes.

Best,

John Nash

The \item command inside \itemize{} lists doesn't take arguments.
Did you mean \describe{} instead of \itemize{}?

I ran into the same issue last week with .Rd files that were
previously accepted on CRAN and concluded that the package checks are
becoming more critical about this aspect of Rd syntax, which is good.

To reproduce the note outside R-devel and by that identify which files
in your package are affected you could run for every Rd file in your
man folder:

tools::checkRd(Rd = file, listOK = FALSE)

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Failing to write config file in linux
Message-ID: <CO6PR22MB243368A25EC7FECF64DFDE6FB6D9A@CO6PR22MB2433.namprd22.prod.outlook.com>

Hi,

My package is failing on linux based systems because of an attempt to write in a location of package. One of the core features that we would like user to have is to modify the values in the config file, for which package has a function for user to provide modified config. In future, they should be able to provide individual parameters for the config for which also we will be writing to config in package directory /inst/ so that it can later be fetched. I understand that policy doesn?t allow writing to home directory. Is there a workaround for this? Or what could be other potential solutions to explore.

Snippet ?
https://github.com/GarrettLab/CroplandConnectivity/blob/923a4a0ca4a0ce8376068ee80986df228ea21d80/geohabnet/R/params.R#L57

Error ?
     ?? Failure ('test-parameters.R:38:3'): Test 6: Test to set new parameters.yaml ??
     Expected `set_parameters(new_param_file)` to run without any conditions.
     ? Actually got a <simpleWarning> with text:
     cannot create file '/home/hornik/tmp/R.check/r-release-gcc/Work/build/Packages/geohabnet/parameters.yaml', reason 'Read-only file system'

Can you place the edited configuration file under
tools::R_user_dir('geohabnet', 'config') instead of the package
directory?

Installed packages may not be modified because they are permitted to be installed with read-only access. You have no option to proceed in this direction.

Configuration files are normally stored in the user's working directory. Dotfiles are a common convention in *nix operating systems, but in Windows the conventions are a bit different. The most general solution is to allow the user to specify an R option in .Rprofile [1], but you can setup defaults depending on the user's OS to back that up in case they don't actually take the steps to do that.

From CRAN policy (which you agreed to when you submitted your package) - note in particular the "nor anywhere else on the file system" part and also note that it tells you what to do in your case:


Packages should not write in the user?s home filespace (including clipboards), nor anywhere else on the file system apart from the R session?s temporary directory (or during installation in the location pointed to by TMPDIR: and such usage should be cleaned up). Installing into the system?s R installation (e.g., scripts to its bin directory) is not allowed.
Limited exceptions may be allowed in interactive sessions if the package obtains confirmation from the user.

For R version 4.0 or later (hence a version dependency is required or only conditional use is possible), packages may store user-specific data, configuration and cache files in their respective user directories obtained from tools::R_user_dir(), provided that by default sizes are kept as small as possible and the contents are actively managed (including removing outdated material).

Thanks for the help, I now tried resubmitting with Sys.setenv("OMP_THREAD_LIMIT" = 2) at the top of the exchange example, but I still get the same note:

Examples with CPU time > 2.5 times elapsed time
          user system elapsed ratio
exchange 1.196   0.04   0.159 7.774

Not sure what to try next.

I wasn't able to reproduce the NOTE either, despite manually setting
the environment variable
_R_CHECK_EXAMPLE_TIMING_CPU_TO_ELAPSED_THRESHOLD=2 before running R CMD
check, but I think I can see the code using OpenMP. Here's what I did:

0. Temporarily lower the system protections against capturing
performance traces of potentially sensitive parts:

echo -1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid

(Set it back to 3 after you're done.)

1. Run the following command with the development version of the
package installed:

env OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 \
 perf record --call-graph drawf,4096 \
 R -e 'library(bssm); system.time(replicate(100, example(exchange)))'

OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 will prevent OpenBLAS from spawning worker
threads if you have it installed. (A different BLAS may need different
environment variables.)

2. Run `perf report` and browse collected call stack information.

The call stacks are hard to navigate, but I think they are not pointing
towards Armadillo. At least, setting ARMA_OPENMP_THREADS=1 doesn't
help, but setting OMP_THREAD_LIMIT=1 does.

In my case recently, after an hour or so?s messing about I disabled some
tests and example executions to get rid of the offending times. I doubt
that i am the only one to do that.

I've downloaded the archived copy of the package from the CRAN FTP
server, installed it and tried:

library(bssm)
Sys.setenv("OMP_THREAD_LIMIT" = 2)
data("exchange")
model <- svm(
 exchange, rho = uniform(0.97,-0.999,0.999),
 sd_ar = halfnormal(0.175, 2), mu = normal(-0.87, 0, 2)
)
system.time(particle_smoother(model, particles = 500))
#    user  system elapsed
#   0.515   0.000   0.073

I set a breakpoint on clone() [*] and got quite a few calls creating
OpenMP threads with the following call stack:

#0  clone () at ../sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/x86_64/clone.S:52

What does arma::eglue_core do?

(gdb) list
/* reformatted a bit */
library/RcppArmadillo/include/armadillo_bits/mp_misc.hpp:64
 int n_threads = (std::min)(
  int(arma_config::mp_threads),
  int((std::max)(int(1), int(omp_get_max_threads())))
 );
(gdb) p arma_config::mp_threads
$3 = 8
(gdb) p (int)omp_get_max_threads()
$4 = 16
(gdb) p (char*)getenv("OMP_THREAD_LIMIT")
$7 = 0x555556576b91 "2"
(gdb) p /x (int)omp_get_thread_limit()
$9 = 0x7fffffff

Sorry for misinforming you about the OMP_THREAD_LIMIT environment
variable: the OpenMP specification requires the program to ignore
modifications to the environment variables after the program has
started [**], so it only works if R is started with OMP_THREAD_LIMIT
set. Additionally, the OpenMP thread limit is not supposed to be
adjusted at runtime at all [***].

Unfortunately for our situation, Armadillo is very insistent in setting
its own number of threads from arma_config::mp_threads (which is
constexpr 8 unless you set preprocessor directives while compiling it)
and omp_get_max_threads (which is the upper bound on the number of
threads that cannot be adjusted at runtime).

What I'm about to suggest is a terrible hack, but since Armadillo seems
to lack the option to set the number of threads at runtime, there might
be no other option.

Before you #include an Armadillo header, every time:

1. #include <omp.h> so that the OpenMP functions are declared and the
#include guard is set

2. Define a static inline function get_number_of_threads returning the
desired number of threads as an int (e.g. referencing an extern int
number_of_threads stored elsewhere)

3. #define omp_get_max_threads get_number_of_threads

Now if you provide an API for the R code to get and set this number, it
should be possible to control the number of threads used by OpenMP code
in Armadillo. Basically, a data.table::setDTthreads() for the copy of
Armadillo inlined inside your package.

If you then compile your package with a large #define
ARMA_OPENMP_THREADS, it will both be able to use more than 8 threads
*and* limit itself when needed.

An alternative course of action is compiling your package with #define
ARMA_OPENMP_THREADS 2 and giving up on more OpenMP threads inside calls
to Armadillo.

	  Chapter 15 in Wickham and Bryan, R Packages, discuss "Advanced 
Testing Techniques". Their current section "15.4.1 Skip a test" includes 
the following:


test_that("some long-running thing works", {
   skip_on_cran()

getting more documentation on this in their book ;-)

We should work on adding such a run-time setter of the number of cores to
RcppArmadillo so that examples can dial down to 2 cores.  I have been doing
just that in package tiledb (via a setting internal to the TileDB Core
library) for 'ages' now and RcppArmadillo could and should offer the same.

You are not the only one; I did the same with some of my examples.

Would it be an option to ask for a default R-option, 'max.ncores', that 
specifies the maximum number of cores a process is allowed to use? CRAN 
could then require that that examples, tests and vignettes respect this 
option. That way there would be one uniform option to specify the 
maximum number of cores processes could use. That would also make it 
easier for system administrators to set default values for this (use the 
entire system; or use one code by default on a shared system).

Of course, we package maintainers could do this without involvement of 
R-code or CRAN. We only need to agree on a name and a default value for 
when the option is missing (0 = use all cores; 1 or 2; or ncores-1 ...).

| | 
| | Sorry for misinforming you about the OMP_THREAD_LIMIT environment
| | variable: the OpenMP specification requires the program to ignore
| | modifications to the environment variables after the program has
| | started [**], so it only works if R is started with OMP_THREAD_LIMIT
| | set. Additionally, the OpenMP thread limit is not supposed to be
| | adjusted at runtime at all [***].
| | 
| | Unfortunately for our situation, Armadillo is very insistent in setting
| | its own number of threads from arma_config::mp_threads (which is
| | constexpr 8 unless you set preprocessor directives while compiling it)
| | and omp_get_max_threads (which is the upper bound on the number of
| | threads that cannot be adjusted at runtime).
| | 
| | What I'm about to suggest is a terrible hack, but since Armadillo seems
| | to lack the option to set the number of threads at runtime, there might
| | be no other option.
| | 
| | Before you #include an Armadillo header, every time:
| | 
| | 1. #include <omp.h> so that the OpenMP functions are declared and the
| | #include guard is set
| | 
| | 2. Define a static inline function get_number_of_threads returning the
| | desired number of threads as an int (e.g. referencing an extern int
| | number_of_threads stored elsewhere)
| | 
| | 3. #define omp_get_max_threads get_number_of_threads
| | 
| | Now if you provide an API for the R code to get and set this number, it
| | should be possible to control the number of threads used by OpenMP code
| | in Armadillo. Basically, a data.table::setDTthreads() for the copy of
| | Armadillo inlined inside your package.
| | 
| | If you then compile your package with a large #define
| | ARMA_OPENMP_THREADS, it will both be able to use more than 8 threads
| | *and* limit itself when needed.
| | 
| | An alternative course of action is compiling your package with #define
| | ARMA_OPENMP_THREADS 2 and giving up on more OpenMP threads inside calls
| | to Armadillo.
| 
| We should work on adding such a run-time setter of the number of cores to
| RcppArmadillo so that examples can dial down to 2 cores.  I have been doing
| just that in package tiledb (via a setting internal to the TileDB Core
| library) for 'ages' now and RcppArmadillo could and should offer the same.

A run-time setter won't work, Armadillo uses a constexpr. But we may have
looked in error at the _wrong_ OpenMP environment variable.  Can you please
try with OMP_NUM_THREADS=2 (instead of OMP_THREAD_LIMIT) ?

Thanks,

I tried with  OMP_NUM_THREADS=2 but unfortunately got the same NOTE as before.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] RFC: an interface to manage use of parallelism in
 packages
Message-ID: <20231025155529.0f83fc93@arachnoid>

Summary: at the end of this message is a link to an R package
implementing an interface for managing the use of execution units in R
packages. As a package maintainer, would you agree to use something
like this? Does it look sufficiently reasonable to become a part of R?
Read on for why I made these particular interface choices.

My understanding of the problem stated by Simon Urbanek and Uwe Ligges
[1,2] is that we need a way to set and distribute the CPU core
allowance between multiple packages that could be using very different
methods to achieve parallel execution on the local machine, including
threads and child processes. We could have multiple well-meaning
packages, each of them calling each other using a different parallelism
technology: imagine parallel::makeCluster(getOption('mc.cores'))
combined with parallel::mclapply(mc.cores = getOption('mc.cores')) and
with an OpenMP program that also spawns getOption('mc.cores') threads.
A parallel BLAS or custom multi-threading using std::thread could add
more fuel to the fire.

Workarounds applied by the package maintainers nowadays are both
cumbersome (sometimes one has to talk to some package that lives
downstream in the call stack and isn't even an explicit dependency,
because it's the one responsible for the threads) and not really enough
(most maintainers forget to restore the state after they are done, so a
single example() may slow down the operations that follow).

The problem is complicated by the fact that not every parallel
operation can explicitly accept the CPU core limit as a parameter. For
example, data.table's implicit parallelism is very convenient, and so
are parallel BLASes (which don't have a standard interface to change
the number of threads), so we shouldn't be prohibiting implicit
parallelism.

It's also not always obvious how to split the cores between the
potentially parallel sections. While it's typically best to start with
the outer loop (e.g. better have 16 R processes solving relatively
small linear algebra problems back to back than have one R process
spinning 15 of its 16 OpenBLAS threads in sched_yield()), it may be
more efficient to give all 16 threads back to BLAS (and save on
transferring the problems and solutions between processes) once the
problems become large enough to give enough work to all of the cores.

So as a user, I would like an interface that would both let me give all
of the cores to the program if that's what I need (something like
setCPUallowance(parallelly::availableCores())) _and_ let me be more
detailed when necessary (something like setCPUallowance(overall = 7,
packages = c(foobar = 1), BLAS = 2) to limit BLAS threads to 2,
disallow parallelism in the foobar package because it wastes too much
time, and limit R as a whole to 7 cores because I want to surf the 'net
on the remaining one while the Monte-Carlo simulation is going on). As
a package developer, I'd rather not think about any of that and just
use a function call like getCPUallowance() for the default number of
cores in every situation.

Can we implement such an interface? The main obstacle here is not being
able to know when each parallel region beings and ends. Does the
package call fork()? std::thread{}? Start a local mirai cluster? We
have to trust (and verify during R CMD check) the package to create the
given number of units of execution and tells us when they are done.

The closest interface that I see being implementable is a system of
tokens with reference semantics: getCPUallowance() returns a special
object containing the number of tokens the caller is allowed to use and
sets an environment variable with the remaining number of cores. Any R
child processes pick up the number of cores from the environment
variable. Any downstream calls to getCPUallowance(), aware of the
tokens already handed out, return a reduced number of remaining CPU
cores. Once the package is done executing a parallel section, it
returns the CPU allowance back to R by calling something like
close(token), which updates the internal allowance value (and the
environment variable). (A finalizer can also be set on the tokens to
ensure that CPU cores won't be lost.)

Here's a package implementing this idea:
<https://codeberg.org/aitap/R-CPUallowance>. Currently missing are
terrible hacks to determine the BLAS type at runtime and resolve the
necessary symbols to set the number of BLAS threads, depending on
whether it's OpenBLAS, flexiblas, MKL, or something else. Does it feel
over-engineered? I hope that, even if not a good solution, this would
let us move towards a unified solution that could just work? on
everything ranging from laptops to CRAN testing machines to HPCs.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] "crossprod" is not a BUILTIN function
Message-ID: <f4cabddb-c2a7-4bfb-a012-18e09b06296a@ineri.org>

Dear All,

Today I was preparing a new version for the RALSA package. I have built 
a Windows package using "devtools::check_win_devel()". I took the built 
Windows package and tested it on a Windows 10 machine to see if 
everything works as intended before submitting the source to CRAN. The 
machine has R 4.3.1, the latest official release. After I load the test 
RALSA package, R displays a message saying "Package RALSA built under R 
version 4.4.0", I guess this is what the win-builder uses when the 
source is sent via "devtools::check_win_devel()".

When testing one of the functions of the newly built RALSA package 
(lsa.corsstabs"), it crashes with the following message:

     Error in crossprod(x = sweep(x = as.matrix(replicated.averages),
     MARGIN = 2, : "crossprod" is not a BUILTIN function

I checked if it is a builtin by:

     grep(pattern = "cross", x = builtins(), value = TRUE)

This returned:

     [1] "tcrossprod" "crossprod"

I am not sure I understand, the "crossprod" function is in the base 
package and is builtin in 4.3.1, is it dropped in 4.4.0? If yes, how to 
overcome this?

Please advise.

Best,
Plamen

The sources show that crossprod has become a primitive function. I don't 
think this should affect any R code that calls crossprod(); are you 
trying to call .Internal(crossprod( ... )) directly?

This was in the news a few weeks ago:

"The matrix multiplication functions ?crossprod()? and ?tcrossprod()? 
are now also primitive and S3 generic, as ?%*%? had become in R 4.3.0."

Can you use R CMD build to make a .tar.gz source package and then
install that on the Windows 10 machine running R 4.3.1? There is
convenience and a lot of added value in both Win-Builder and devtools,
but it shouldn't be necessary to rely on 96 CRAN packages and an online
service just to build a package.

crossprod(x,y) has indeed been recently changed from
.Internal(crossprod(x, y)) to .Primitive("crossprod"). This makes it
possible for a binary package prepared using R-devel (with a call to
.Primitive('crossprod')) to misbehave on a released version of R (which
does have .Internal(crossprod(...)) but not .Primitive('crossprod')).

Installing from source will avoid this problem. So will building the
binary package using R-4.3.1 to run it on a different machine with
R-4.3.1.

Hi Ivan,

Interesting package, and I'll provide more feedback later. For a
comparison, I'd recommend looking at how GNU make does parallel processing.
It uses the concept of job server and job slots. What I like about it is
that it is implemented at the OS level because make needs to support
interacting with non-make processes. On Windows it uses a named semaphore,
and on Unix-like system it uses named pipes or simple pipes to pass tokens
around.

https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Job-Slots

Cheers,
Reed

Thank you very much for your responses Duncan and Ivan.

I do not call .Internal(crossprod( ... )) directly. I use crossprod() 
just once in the entire package, the actual line of code is

unname(obj = crossprod(x = sweep(x = as.matrix(replicated.averages), 
MARGIN = 2, mean.replicate.averages, FUN = "-"))*des.scale.fac)

I followed Ivan's advice, built a binary package from source in R 4.3.1 
on Windows 10, then tested it on another Windows 10 machine with R 
4.3.1. The problem did not occur et all.

If I understand Ivan's email, my package should work on R 4.3.1, but 
what about newer versions? I checked some packages that were released 
today, e.g. abn, these were built by CRAN "using R Under development 
(unstable) (2023-10-24 r85407 ucrt)". Does this mean mine will fail on 
the current released version (4.3.1) if built by CRAN. As far as I see 
from the R Developer Page (https://developer.r-project.org), there is a 
new version (4.3.2) scheduled for October 31, 2023. Should I better wait 
until then?

Best,
Plamen

There are two kinds of builds:  source builds (producing the .tar.gz 
file) and binary builds (producing the .zip file on Windows).  Binary 
builds are specific to R minor versions:  if you build on R version 
x.y.z, you can't expect the package to work if either x or y changes.

Source builds should work on other R versions, though sometimes moving 
to earlier versions will cause problems (because the format of files in 
the .tar.gz file may have changed), or your package relies on features 
that weren't present earlier.  Generally .tar.gz files will work on 
later versions (though changes in R might break it).

So if you did a binary build on R 4.4.x and tested it on R 4.3.1, it's 
not at all surprising that it failed.  If you did a source build on R 
4.4.x and it failed on R 4.3.1, that's more surprising.

The source package (the .tar.gz file obtained using R CMD build) will
keep working fine on both R 4.3 and R 4.4.

The binary package (the .zip file obtained using R CMD INSTALL --build
and produced on Win-Builder) is only guaranteed to work with the R
version that was used to build the binary package.

This is the reason why https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RALSA offers
a single download of the source package...

...but multiple, separate downloads of binary versions of the package,
for R-4.4, R-4.3, and R-4.2:

I apologize for misreading Ivan's first email. I now installed from the 
tar.gz source file, everything worked as expected.

Thank you both for the thorough explanations.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] API client package failing due to API authentication
Message-ID: <CABm0ymkJvxQPL7eqOjbhvJJHrPYzQc8dJcMmvQJUsRD0GOqLqg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

My package https://github.com/cole-johanson/smartsheetr requires an
environment variable, the API access token, to run most of the functions.
The steps for setting this are documented in the README, but my package is
being auto-rejected by CRAN for failing the examples.

I have wrapped the examples with the roxygen2 tag *\dontrun*, but it is
still attempting to run the examples.

Should I report this as a false positive, or is there a step I am missing?

Thank you!

Judging by the latest commit at
<https://github.com/cole-johanson/smartsheetr/commit/5e4f8fb23b1f9d91c5941d9f116f7f076d785d8f>,
you forgot to run roxygen2::roxygenise() to regenerate the man/*.Rd
files (which is what R cares about). Your use of the Rd tag \dontrun{}
is otherwise fine and should prevent the code from being run.

I am not sure whether it's acceptable to \dontrun{} every possible test
and example, but if the code useless without a valid API key, so be it.
Maybe you could write your examples in
if(nzchar(getenv('SMARTSHEET_API_TOKEN'))) withAutoprint({ ... })
instead to make it possible to run

SMARTSHEET_API_TOKEN=YOURTOKEN R CMD check shartsheetr*.tar.gz

...and have all the tests run, the way your CI is currently set up.

You should not attempt to run the examples when they could fail e.g. when no
API key is present as it the case for CRAN.

Jouni,

My CRANberriesFeed reports a new bssm package at CRAN, congratulations for
sorting this out. [1,2] The OMP_NUM_THREADS setting is indeed all it takes,
and it _does_ seem to be read even from a running session: i.e. you can set
this inside an R session and the OpenMP code considers it in the same
process. Good!

As some of us mentioned, your usage pattern of setting
'Sys.setenv("OMP_NUM_THREADS" = 2)' everywhere _leaves_ that value so you
permanently ham-string the behaviour of a session which runs an example or
test of your package: the same session will never get back to 'all cores' by
itself so adding a resetter to the initial value (maybe via on.exit()) may be
a good idea for the next package revision if you have any energy left for
this question :)

Again, congrats for sorting it out, and sorry for the trouble. I long argued
CRAN should set the behaviour-defining environment variable, that
OMP_NUM_THREADS, for the tests and examples it wants to run under reduced
load.  Alas, that's not where we ended up.

Cheers,  Dirk

[1] http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/cranberries/2023/10/27#bssm_2.0.2

[2] Your NEWS file calls this 'fix weird CRAN issues with parallelisation on
Debian.'. There is nothing 'weird' here (it behaves as designed, computers do
that to us), and it is not just on Debian but on any system where the build
has a) access to OpenMP so uses it and b) measures real time to elapsed time
with a cap of 2 as CRAN does.

Hi Dirk,

Actually, the OMP_NUM_THREADS worked for vignettes and testthat tests, but didn't help with the examples. However, I just wrapped the problematic example with \donttest as for some reason this issue only happened with a single seemingly simple example (hence the "weird" in the earlier NEWS due to frustration, I changed this to the CRAN version).

Thanks for reminding me about the resetting the number of cores, will fix that to the next version.

Best,
Jouni

I have an idea for a RcppArmadillo-based helper function. We can save the
initial values of the environment variable in .onLoad and cache it. A simple
helper function pair can then dial the environment variable down and reset it
to the cached value.

Hi Dirk,

Looking more closely earlier failures, vignettes have always worked fine but the note on tests said that the CPU time was only 2.7 times over elapsed time, so maybe I was just lucky this time and got under 2.5. ;) Or testthat does something special...

I have an idea for a RcppArmadillo-based helper function. We can save the
initial values of the environment variable in .onLoad and cache it. A simple
helper function pair can then dial the environment variable down and reset it
to the cached value.

I have some better news.  While we established that 'in theory' setting the
environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS would help (and I maintain that it is a
great PITA that CRAN does not do so as a general fix for this issue) it does
*not help* once R is started.  OpenMP only considers the variable once at
startup and does not re-read it.  So we cannot set from R once R has started.

But OpenMP offers a setter (and a getter) for the thread count value.

And using it addresses the issue.  I created a demo package [1] which, when
running on a system with both OpenMP and 'enough cores' (any modern machine
will do) exhibits the warning from R CMD check --as-cran with timing enabled
(i.e. env vars set).  When an additional environment variable 'SHOWME' is set
to 'yes', it successfully throttles via the exposed OpenMP setter.  In our
example, Armadillo uses it to calibrate its thread use, a lower setting is
followed, and the warning is gone.

I will add more convenient wrappers to RcppArmadillo itself. These are
currently in a branch [2] and their use is illustrated in the help page and
example of fastLm demo function [3].  I plan to make a new RcppArmadillo
release with this change in the coming days, the setter and re-setter will
work for any OpenMP threading changes. So if you use RcppArmadillo, this
should help. (And of course there always was RhpcBLASctl doing this too.)

Message-ID: <246366687.35114098.1698677911336.JavaMail.zimbra@u-bordeaux.fr>

Hi there, 

I'm sorry to disturb, I hope I send a mail at the right place. 





I have been encountering a challenge with an R package that I've been working on, which was recently removed from CRAN due to some issues in Fortran. 

It appears that I have addressed the Fortran issues, but upon resubmission to CRAN, the package was not accepted, and the following error was returned : 


''With clang17 it still fails to install: 

error: loc("/data/gannet/ripley/R/packages/incoming/frailtypack.Rcheck/00_pkg_src/frailtypack/src/Integrale_mult_scl.f90":1811:17): 'omp.reduction' op must be used within an operation supporting reduction clause interface 
error: verification of lowering to FIR failed 

LLVM trunk gives the same error. 
'' 




I have attached the portion of the code where this issue is reported. From my understanding, it appears to be related to parallelization, but I have been unable to resolve it on my own. 

I would greatly appreciate any assistance or advice that you might be able to offer. If you require any additional information, please do not hesitate to let me know. 




Moreover, I don't know if it is normal or not, but when I check my package with R CMD chech --as-cran, I don't have any error or note message. But when I submit the package to the CRAN, they return errors and notes. 








Thank you very much for your time and consideration. 




Best regards, 




Romain Pierlot

I'm not 100% sure, but I currently think that this is a compiler bug.

You have a variable, ss, declared inside a function.

If nb_procs==1, you start an OpenMP parallel region with a reduction on
that variable. The OpenMP parallel region starts and ends inside that
if clause. Outside the parallel region, in another branch, you add to
it as usual.

Flang-new complains about your use of the 'ss' variable outside the
parallel region, alleging that it's not valid for an OpenMP reduction.
There is no OpenMP reduction in sight where the error is reported. I
think that Flang-new is wrong to signal an error here.

Unfortunately, proving that this is a compiler bug might be hard. I'll
try to reproduce your problem, starting by downloading and compiling
flang from https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git commit
092b6c5ee3707ea10b9f10d0a674e8d12395369b (as stated at
<https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/clang17/frailtypack.log>). I hope
it will be possible to simplify Integrale_mult_scl.f90 until it looks
manageable for their bug tracker.

These errors only happen with the "flang-new" Fortran compiler that's
part of the LLVM compiler infrastructure. You're probably using
gfortran or some other, more well-polished Fortran compiler.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Recent dev version of R CMD check fails when a
 package function named X also has a parameter named X
Message-ID: <fb6e9cba-df63-4d02-96b2-83e7b0f66955@phonetik.uni-muenchen.de>

Hi R people,

I am the maintainer of the emuR package and I am having a problem with 
recent versions of R CMD check.

CRAN?s r-devel test suites [1] have started to emit a NOTE about the 
HTML version of the manual:

> Version: 2.4.1
> Check: HTML version of manual
> Result: NOTE
> ??? Found the following HTML validation problems:
> ??? query.html:50:9 (query.Rd:22): Warning: <code> anchor "query"

> r-devel-linux-x86_64-fedora-gcc, r-devel-windows-x86_64
>
This is caused by one of my package?s functions that is named query and 
also has a parameter named query.

I think I have tracked this down to SVN revision r85407 of R. With 
earlier versions:

R CMD Rdconv -t html query.Rd

would output (line 50, as referenced by the NOTE):

<tr><td><code id="query_:_query">query</code></td>

But newer versions output:

<tr><td><code id="query">query</code></td>

Notice the difference in id. The id "query" appears both here and 
further up in the file, specifically in the h2 heading. This triggers 
the HTML validation problem. I suppose this is a bug in the experimental 
table of contents feature? As such, should I rather post this to R-devel?

Unfortunately, this also prevents me from uploading a new version of my 
package, since it does not get past CRAN?s automatic pretest. Can I 
resubmit my new version and simply state in the comments that I cannot 
fix the NOTE from r-devel at this point? Or should I rather wait until 
this is changed upstream? (the described NOTE is the only complaint from 
the pretest). Changing the function or parameter name is not an option, 
they have been used in this package ever since it was released a couple 
of years ago.

This NOTE can also be reproduced with a minimal R package that has 
nothing but a hello function with a parameter named hello.

Thanks for reading this. I appreciate any help.

Yes, sorry, my bad.

r85440 (just committed) should have a temporary fix by omitting the id
from the <h2> title. Please let me know if problems still persist.

Message-ID: <BLAPR05MB7235EEB2A9E6BC5DB6117972BEA1A@BLAPR05MB7235.namprd05.prod.outlook.com>

Hi,

I'm the maintainer for a few packages, one of which is currently failing CRAN checks on Mac OS because Matrix is not available in my required version (the latest). I had to fix a few things due to changes in the latest Matrix package because of how qr works and I thought, given the apparent API change, I should then require the latest version. My error is, "Package required and available but unsuitable version: 'Matrix'"

When I look at the NEWS in Matrix there is no mention of Mac OS issues, what the latest stable version of Matrix is, nor when a fix is expected. What version do MacOS version test Matrix with by default? Where is this documented? I assumes it always tested with the latest version on CRAN, so I'm a bit surprised. Or will this be resolved soon and I shouldn't bother CRAN maintainers with a new version of my package?

Best,
Paul

can you give us a bit more detail? Which package, which build and where you got the errors? Older builds may not have the latest Matrix.

Hello everyone,

I recently submitted my NMRphasing R package. While most of the check results are fine, I encountered two issues on macOS. The major error is:

'DLL requires the use of native symbols'

I'm wondering how I can resolve this issue. Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you in advance!?

Dear Simon,

Could you please look into this? The machines running r-release-macos-*
checks seem to have MassSpecWavelet < 1.66 installed instead of the
current version, 1.68. I think that MassSpecWavelet >= 1.66 would be
version-appropriate for R-4.3 (Bioconductor >= 3.17).

Interesting. It's not you, it's the MassSpecWavelet package, but the
error has already been fixed there. Look at the traceback produced for
the error:

>> Error in localMaximumSlidingWindow(x, winSize) :
>>  DLL requires the use of native symbols
>> Calls: MPC_DANM ... getLocalMaximumCWT -> localMaximum ->
>>        localMaximumSlidingWindow

The error happens in a function called 'localMaximumSlidingWindow',
called from 'localMaximum', called from 'getLocalMaximumCWT'.
'getLocalMaximumCWT' belongs to the MassSpecWavelet package.

The problem is that the maintainer sets R_forceSymbols(info, TRUE)
but then uses .Call() with a string containing the name of the function
instead of a special object that directly refers to that function. The
fix for that has been committed half a year ago
<https://code.bioconductor.org/browse/MassSpecWavelet/commit/496de2969b2f43f8be00f1966611497fa3053937>
and became part of the 1.66.0 release and the following versions of the
package. The fixed package versions went into Bioconductor 3.17 (for
R-4.3) but not 3.16 (for R-4.2).

Hello,

Thanks for suggesting tools::R_user_dir(). I was able to implement and resubmit. This issue prompted me to read the policies thoroughly here - https://r-pkgs.org/release.html .

Best Regards,

[External Email]

From CRAN policy (which you agreed to when you submitted your package) - note in particular the "nor anywhere else on the file system" part and also note that it tells you what to do in your case:


Packages should not write in the user?s home filespace (including clipboards), nor anywhere else on the file system apart from the R session?s temporary directory (or during installation in the location pointed to by TMPDIR: and such usage should be cleaned up). Installing into the system?s R installation (e.g., scripts to its bin directory) is not allowed.
Limited exceptions may be allowed in interactive sessions if the package obtains confirmation from the user.

For R version 4.0 or later (hence a version dependency is required or only conditional use is possible), packages may store user-specific data, configuration and cache files in their respective user directories obtained from tools::R_user_dir(), provided that by default sizes are kept as small as possible and the contents are actively managed (including removing outdated material).

One of the core features that we would like user to have is to modify the values in the config file, for which package has a function for user to provide modified config. In future, they should be able to provide individual parameters for the config for which also we will be writing to config in package directory /inst/ so that it can later be fetched. I understand that policy doesn?t allow writing to home directory. Is there a workaround for this? Or what could be other potential solutions to explore.

I am guessing that they mean EdSurvey:

     https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_EdSurvey.html

Probably Matrix 1.6-1.1 is not installed on r-oldrel-macos-arm64,
even though it can be, because it was not released until R 4.3-z.

AFAIK, methods for 'qr' have not been touched since Matrix 1.6-0, and
even those changes should have been backwards compatible, modulo handling
of dimnames (class sparseQR gained a Dimnames slot in 1.6-0).

So I don't see a clear reason for requiring 1.6-1.1.  Requiring 1.6-0
might make sense, if somehow EdSurvey depends on how class sparseQR
preserves dimnames.  But IIRC our rev. dep. checks at that time did not
reveal problems with EdSurvey.

Thank you so much - Ivan!

I think that I need to update R to the latest version then.

Have a great day!

Dear Simon,

Could you please look into this? The machines running r-release-macos-*
checks seem to have MassSpecWavelet < 1.66 installed instead of the
current version, 1.68. I think that MassSpecWavelet >= 1.66 would be
version-appropriate for R-4.3 (Bioconductor >= 3.17).

Interesting. It's not you, it's the MassSpecWavelet package, but the
error has already been fixed there. Look at the traceback produced for
the error:

>> Error in localMaximumSlidingWindow(x, winSize) :
>>  DLL requires the use of native symbols
>> Calls: MPC_DANM ... getLocalMaximumCWT -> localMaximum ->
>>        localMaximumSlidingWindow

The error happens in a function called 'localMaximumSlidingWindow',
called from 'localMaximum', called from 'getLocalMaximumCWT'.
'getLocalMaximumCWT' belongs to the MassSpecWavelet package.

The problem is that the maintainer sets R_forceSymbols(info, TRUE)
but then uses .Call() with a string containing the name of the function
instead of a special object that directly refers to that function. The
fix for that has been committed half a year ago
<https://code.bioconductor.org/browse/MassSpecWavelet/commit/496de2969b2f43f8be00f1966611497fa3053937>
and became part of the 1.66.0 release and the following versions of the
package. The fixed package versions went into Bioconductor 3.17 (for
R-4.3) but not 3.16 (for R-4.2).

Wow. Building LLVM is an adventure, and I don't mean it in a good way.
I had to patch flang/include/flang/Semantics/symbol.h because it
declares `friend class std::array` while my copy of the C++ standard
library has a `struct std::array`, which makes the friend declaration
an error. Naively thinking that I would be helping debug the problem, I
tried compiling a debugging build of LLVM, only to watch in horror as
it consumed all disk space I could offer it. I eventually ran out of
things to delete after the build directory reached 100 gigabytes in
size, while the build still had 1000 out of 6000 targets to compile and
link. Even the release build failed at 410 remaining targets because of
a missing -fPIC somewhere in the compiler command line. Thankfully, it
still produced a working `flang-new` executable.

A release build of LLVM + flang-new takes a relatively reasonable 
8.2 GBytes of storage. The computers that helped launch the first
people into space had 2 kWords of memory, but nowadays you need more
than 256 MBytes of RAM to launch a bird into a pig and 10 GBytes of
storage in order to compile a compiler. This is what progress looks
like.

I was able to reduce the example to the following program:

program main
    implicit none

    real :: sum = 0
    integer :: i, n = 10

    sum = sum + 1. ! <-- error here if followed by OpenMP reduction

    !$OMP PARALLEL DO default(none) PRIVATE (i) SHARED(n) &
    !$OMP REDUCTION(+:sum) SCHEDULE(Dynamic,1)
    do i=1,n
        sum = sum + real(i)
    end do
    !$OMP END PARALLEL DO

    print *, sum
end

% flang-new -c -o /dev/null src.f90 -fopenmp
error: loc("src.f90":7:5): 'omp.reduction' op must be used within an
operation supporting reduction clause interface
error: verification of lowering to FIR failed

gfortran raises no errors or warnings for the test program. Bug
reported at <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/70828>.

Would that be enough proof of a compiler bug, or do we need a
confirmation from the developers?

Mikael,

current Matrix fails checks on R-oldrel so that's why only the last working version is installed:

Thanks.  We did see those ERRORs, stemming from use (since Matrix 1.6-0)
of amsmath commands in Rd files.  These have been supported since R 4.2.2,
but r-oldrel-macos-* (unlike r-oldrel-windows-*) continues to run R 4.2.0.
My expectation was that those machines would begin running R >= 4.2.2 well
before the R 4.4.0 release, but apparently that was wrong.

I am hesitant to complicate our Rd files with conditions on R versions
only to support PDF output for R < 4.2.2, but maybe we can consider it
for the Matrix 1.6-2 release if it is really a barrier for others ...

Mikael,

in that case I think your requirements are wrong - Matrix says R >= 3.5.0 which is apparently incorrect - from what you say it should be 4.2.2?. I can certainly update to 4.2.3 if necessary.

Cheers,
Simon

ROFL! Seconded!

The quote itself has a bit of greybeard smell to it, but the "ran out of stuff to delete at 100GB with 1000 out of 6000 targets compiled" had me in stitches.

If i remember rightly one of the early Algol compilers for the IBM
mainframe couldnt be compiled on an IBM mainframe because it was too memory
hungry (it had to be cross compiled). The numbers change, but the problems
don?t, except that i haven?t run a compile lately that ran out of memory
like that.

Thanks.  It seems that we were mistaken in our feeling (IIRC) that it would
be "OK" to implicitly require '--no-manual' on versions of R from 3.5.0 to
4.2.1, not changing our Depends.

We will fix this in Matrix 1.6-2, probably by conditionalizing or otherwise
replacing the amsmath commands and probably _not_ by changing to depend on
R >= 4.2.2.  Martin may have more to say in "the morning".

In the mean time (i.e., while we are stuck with Matrix 1.6-1.1), it may help
to update to R 4.2.3 on r-oldrel-macos-* and/or to have EdSurvey revert its
strict version requirement, unless there are clear examples justifying one.

Mikael

Note that dependin on R >= 4.2.2 does not work. We need dependencies of 
the form R >= x.y.0. This is also part of the checks.

Reason is that we have only one binary repository for one R-x.y.? 
series. On WIndows, where we check with R-4.2.3, a binary would be 
created and hence R-4.2.[0-1] would not see any valid Matrix binaries.

So please either make this work on R >= 4.2.0 or require R >= 4.3.0. If 
the latter, ideally with an interim version that works for R >= 4.2.0, 
so that we valid binaries with correct dependency declarations again.

Best,
Uwe

I agree (*not* to raise Matrix pkg's R version dependency).

Yes, indeed.
And as we learned, R >= 4.2.0 would not help for r-oldrel-macos

I (am unhappy but) agree to take the responsibility for our
decision to go ahead and use much nicer LaTeX formula for
matrices etc, in our help pages {thinking that indeed people who'd
install Matrix on an old R version would always be able to read
Matrix manual pages via web search (as it seems to me 95% of
people do nowadays) ... or then have someone in their
organization to figure out how to use a newer amsmath (latex) package if
 they really really want the Matrix pdf manual offline}.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Package bioOED has been removed from CRAN just for
 personal reasons
Message-ID: <CAMo5YQYHZkedU6On_576c2J8MXK4DjfmBoHC2dYRjcVGWJHkVQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear community,

I feel dismay for having to write this email, but the issue must be brought
up. On the 20th of October, I received an email from CRAN warning me of an
issue with one of the packages I maintain (bioOED). The package depended on
MEIGOR, a package that was no longer available in Bioconductor. I was given
until 2023-11-03 to fix the issue.

I contacted the MEIGOR maintainers and they told me they were migrating to
CRAN. Yesterday, they contacted me again, telling me they needed more time
for the migration. Hence, I responded to the email I received from CRAN,
asking for an extension of the previous deadline (2023-11-03).

To my surprise, it is not just that the extension was not granted, but the
package has been removed from CRAN today (2023-11-01). Two days before the
deadline (2023-11-03): https://cran.r-project.org/package=bioOED

Then, I checked my inbox and I saw an email from one of the CRAN
maintainers, showing that the package was removed because he had felt
offended by my email. I copy-paste the email below.

I understand that maintaining CRAN must be a huge work. I also work in
academia, so I am totally aware of all the extra work that is required from
us. But it is unreasonable that a package can be removed just because a
maintainer throws a tantrum

Again, I am really sorry I had to write this email, but CRAN cannot work if
we allow this type of situation.

Kind regards,
Alberto Garre

I don't think this is true. The reason is that your package depends on 
an unavailable package, so cannot be installed. See 
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bioOED/index.html where the 
reason is publicly stated.

If I were you I'd simply wait once MEIGOR is on CRAN and then publish 
the archived package again.

Best,
Tomas

I agree with that interpretation.  A possibly faster alternative would 
be to remove the dependence on MEIGOR, and resubmit once that is done 
and the package is working again.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] CRAN archival: Does CRAN un-archive some packages
 automatically?
Message-ID: <CAFDcVCQwVMSZXKXROyP8EUQJr57Cjppfam+Q6Ca=quzopn-VWg@mail.gmail.com>

I'm asking here to spare the CRAN Team a direct message, but also
because the answer is of interest to others:

Consider a package PkgA that was archived on CRAN, because it fails
checks and errors that were not corrected in time.  At the moment when
package PkgA is archived, it will trigger automatic archiving of other
CRAN packages that has a hard dependency on it. Say, packages PkgB and
PkgC were archived automatically, because of their dependency on PkgA.

Question: If PkgA is at a later point revived on CRAN, will CRAN
unarchive PkgB and PkgC automatically? Or, should the maintainers of
PkgB and PkgC resubmit? If they have to resubmit, should they submit
identical versions and tarballs as before, or do they have to bump the
version?

I believe the version must be bumped and pushed. This was the case for me
as my package was not un-archived.

I don't know the answer to your first question, but I'd guess "no".  The 
maintainers of PkgB and PkgC should have already resubmitted, demoting 
PkgA to a "Suggests:" dependency or dropping it completely.

If they chose not to do that, then at the hypothetical time when PkgA is 
revived, each of PkgB and PkgC would need full testing to see if they 
were passing the current versions of the CRAN checks with the new 
version of PkgA.  That's something for their maintainers to do, not CRAN.

Regarding your last question:  if it turns out the original version 
still passes with the new PkgA, then I think it's still better to bump 
the version number.  It would need an exception to the usual "new 
submissions need new version numbers" rule.  Exceptions waste CRAN's time.

Dear Alberto,

I have had a small number of CRAN-related email exchanges ..........
made it clear that his idea of politeness and my idea of 
politeness are incompatible. The email you are quoting reminds me very 
much of these exchanges.

But I try to be pragmatic about it. It?s not the end of the world if my 
packages are not on CRAN for a couple of weeks. In the end, they were 
archived because tests were failing and they were always (re-)accepted 
into CRAN once the automatic tests passed again. No personal matters 
involved.

.................  As a package 
maintainer, I am also contributing my share, especially towards my own 
discipline, and so are you. That is why there is contact in the first 
place. I wouldn't care too much whether or not that allows either of us 
to consider the other a peer.

I don?t know why your package appears to have been archived two days 
early. But otherwise I agree with Tomas and Duncan. There is a clear 
path forward for your package. Based on my own experience, there is no 
reason to believe that it will be rejected by CRAN on personal grounds, 
once the automatic tests pass.

Best

Markus

My idea of politeness, and I think also .......'s, is that you 
don't discuss private discussions in public without agreement from all

Hi everyone,

I updated my package, but found a NOTE for r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-clang.
See https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-clang/tinycodet-00check.html.

The NOTE is:
checking HTML version of manual ... [3s/5s] NOTE
Found the following HTML validation problems:
pkgs.html:66:9 (pkgs.Rd:24): Warning: <code> anchor "pkgs" already defined

As is often the case, these NOTES do not inform me at all. What does this NOTE entail exactly, and why is the issue only present for Debian?

Kind regards,

Tony.

That sounds like a bug in the check code which has been fixed.  Do you 
have a function named pkgs() with an argument also named pkgs?

Looks like the same problem as here:
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-package-devel/2023q4/009790.html

Should have been fixed in SVN r85440. Unfortunately, the check machine
is still running r85433. This NOTE should go away by itself after a
while.

I really appreciate your assistance, and the time you dedicated to building LLVM ! 

I noticed that you've posted the issue on GitHub, thanks for this too, I'll stay updated and regularly check the answers. 

Does a compiler bug imply that the issue doesn't come from from the code?

Once again, thank you for your help!

Wow. Building LLVM is an adventure, and I don't mean it in a good way.
I had to patch flang/include/flang/Semantics/symbol.h because it
declares `friend class std::array` while my copy of the C++ standard
library has a `struct std::array`, which makes the friend declaration
an error. Naively thinking that I would be helping debug the problem, I
tried compiling a debugging build of LLVM, only to watch in horror as
it consumed all disk space I could offer it. I eventually ran out of
things to delete after the build directory reached 100 gigabytes in
size, while the build still had 1000 out of 6000 targets to compile and
link. Even the release build failed at 410 remaining targets because of
a missing -fPIC somewhere in the compiler command line. Thankfully, it
still produced a working `flang-new` executable.

A release build of LLVM + flang-new takes a relatively reasonable 
8.2 GBytes of storage. The computers that helped launch the first
people into space had 2 kWords of memory, but nowadays you need more
than 256 MBytes of RAM to launch a bird into a pig and 10 GBytes of
storage in order to compile a compiler. This is what progress looks
like.

I was able to reduce the example to the following program:

program main
    implicit none

    real :: sum = 0
    integer :: i, n = 10

    sum = sum + 1. ! <-- error here if followed by OpenMP reduction

    !$OMP PARALLEL DO default(none) PRIVATE (i) SHARED(n) &
    !$OMP REDUCTION(+:sum) SCHEDULE(Dynamic,1)
    do i=1,n
        sum = sum + real(i)
    end do
    !$OMP END PARALLEL DO

    print *, sum
end

% flang-new -c -o /dev/null src.f90 -fopenmp
error: loc("src.f90":7:5): 'omp.reduction' op must be used within an
operation supporting reduction clause interface
error: verification of lowering to FIR failed

gfortran raises no errors or warnings for the test program. Bug
reported at <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/70828>.

Would that be enough proof of a compiler bug, or do we need a
confirmation from the developers?

Yes. I'm sure (corrections welcome!) that it's not an error to use a
Fortran variable before an OpenMP parallel block that also uses it for
a reduction operation.

One more OpenMP-related problem that may still bite you is having to
limit the number of threads. Since there's currently no centralised way
of regulating all kinds of parallelism used in a given R session [1],
you will have to use no more than two threads by default [2], although
you are always welcome to start more if the user explicitly passes such
an option to one of your functions.

(I'm trying to help with this [3], but it may take a long while to
implement properly and even longer to ensure that this is the right
solution from both technical and social viewpoints.)

Thank you for pointing me towards the job server in GNU make! This is
exactly the kind of suggestion I was looking for. I also appreciate you
signing up for an account on Codeberg to give me a more detailed
writeup.

I agree that named semaphores seem to be a better fit for the job than
my first design. There are some corner cases to handle (what if the
parent process starts up and the semaphore already exists? what if the
user wants to reduce the allowance but the semaphore count is lower than
expected? what are the stongest restrictions on a POSIX semaphore name?
I've seen implementations placing them under /dev/shm%s and /tmp/%s.sem
so far), but it should be possible for me to implement the core concept
in a few days.

Additional care might be needed regarding the number of BLAS threads. R
might have to become its own FlexiBLAS and pass an additional
environment variable to children to ensure the limit being taken into
account.

Er, the above is wrong, because '<' should be '>=' and because '#2' (which
is conceptually verbatim text) should use \verb{} for PDF and HTML output,
not \eqn{}.  For Matrix 1.6-2 I have created man/macros/local.Rd and added:

\newcommand{\Seqn}{\ifelse{latex}{\Sexpr[results=rd]{if (getRversion() >= 
"4.2.2") "\\\\\\\\eqn{#1}" else 
"\\\\\\\\verb{#2}"}}{\ifelse{html}{\Sexpr[results=rd]{if (getRversion() >= 
"4.2.0") "\\\\\\\\eqn{#1}" else 
"\\\\\\\\verb{#2}"}}{\Sexpr[results=rd]{"\\\\\\\\eqn{#2}"}}}}

\newcommand{\Sdeqn}{\ifelse{latex}{\Sexpr[results=rd]{if (getRversion() >= 
"4.2.2") "\\\\\\\\deqn{#1}" else 
"\\\\\\\\preformatted{#2}"}}{\ifelse{html}{\Sexpr[results=rd]{if (getRversion() 
 >= "4.2.0") "\\\\\\\\deqn{#1}" else 
"\\\\\\\\preformatted{#2}"}}{\Sexpr[results=rd]{"\\\\\\\\deqn{#2}"}}}}

Now Matrix 1.6-2 passes its Rd checks under my checkout of R-3-5-branch.
Some examples and tests fail for unrelated reasons.  I'll fix those, too ...

A hack that seems to work is (whitespace added for readability):

     \newcommand{\Seqn}{
       \ifelse{latex}{
         \Sexpr[results=rd]{if (getRversion() < "4.2.2") "\\\\\\\\eqn{#1}" else 
"\\\\\\\\eqn{#2}"}
       }{
         \ifelse{html}{
           \Sexpr[results=rd]{if (getRversion() < "4.2.0") "\\\\\\\\eqn{#1}" 
else "\\\\\\\\eqn{#2}"}
         }{
           \Sexpr[results=rd]{"\\\\\\\\eqn{#2}"}
         }
       }
     }

as amsmath support for PDF output and KaTeX support for HTML output
were introduced in R 4.2.2 and 4.2.0, respectively.

Sadly I really do seem to need 8 escapes:

     \Seqn{\\\\\\\\text{min}(m,n) \\\\\\\\times n}{min(m,n)-by-n}

Maybe one of the Rd experts here can suggest an improvement ...

I've just had a look at the initial posting in this thread

https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-package-devel/2023q4/009810.html  

and can see nothing rude or offensive in the email ....
that was copied and pasted into that posting.

I find *your* email far more offensive than anything that .....
has ever written.  Get a life.

cheers,

Hi, David:

	  ....................


	  I've been in the military, and I've learned to ignore the tone and 
look for the value in comments I receive. I've learned a lot from 
........., and others. When the tone seemed less supportive or 
even insulting, I'm very glad the person took the time to comment and 
didn't decide not to reply for fear of offending me. I'm more productive 
and a better human for all the help I've gotten from this and other 
R-related lists.

Dear R-package-devel readers *and* notably writers,

In Europe there are (diverse) laws about privacy etc, and those,
(and/or some politeness) do not allow
free citing of private e-mail communications in public
nor ad hominem remarks in such public communication.

For this reason, I (as mailing list co-maintainer, and notably
responsible for the lawfulness of the public mailing list archives on
our web server) now spent about 2 hours  to carefully obey such
privacy requirements (carefully editing + recreating all the html archives).
{In another similar case, my employer, ETH Zurich, did urge me
"from above" to spend my time with such a tedious and ungratifying job ...}
This is *NOT* something I'd be happy to redo.

So *please* do not misuse such a public mailing list and do keep
your private opinions private in such a case in the future!

which can you get 4 different answers; using `showMatches` argument
(which I think I had added), e.g. now gives

Matching row numbers: 90, 124, 177, 271

just over 20 minutes my problem is solved!

Our great-great grandchildren as yet unborn may read some of the stupid questions and/or answers that I
and perhaps others give from time to time. I'd rather get flamed for saying something stupid in public on
this list than to continue to provide substandard service to the people with whom I work because I
perpetrated the same mistake in an environment in which no one questioned so effectively my errors.

Guys,

Martin, I am very sorry you spent all that time. I am sceptical that this
is a correct interpretation of the law, given what I see on Twitter daily,
and I would not take a university as an authority on this. But that is
neither here nor there ? if I made you waste your time, that's my bad and
I'm sorry.

More generally, I have absolutely no wish to spend time beating up on any
individual ? and people have kindly sent comments off-list that gave me
context about the specific case. But persistent rudeness is harmful, and
there ought to be a way to address it. Many projects use codes of conduct
for this purpose.

So one thing to keep in mind that doing volunteer public facing work tends 
to expose people to all kinds of unreasonable requests.

Those who endure often become more direct, and that's fine. Or, and 
people in commercial companies can be very direct too.

One thing that helps is to be extra-polite to a person who is doing a lot 
of volunteer work, and who is likely way oversubscribed.

Focusing on practical matters, if you take a step back things look 
pretty good:

Your package has dependency on a package that you have not written and
that is maintained outside CRAN. It was bound to break sooner or later.

However, the last time you updated bioOED was in 2019 and there was no 
need to do anything for more than 3 years. That's amazing ! And probably 
made possible by being a little bit too direct on occasion.

Dear R-Package-Devel,

As part of GWSDAT package (https://github.com/waynegitshell/GWSDAT) we support the option to output plots to a WMF (https://r-graphics.org/recipe-output-vector-wmf) format if, and only if,  the user is on Windows. However, when I run the package checks on here it complains about using a platform specific function with the following message:

  Found the platform-specific device:
    'win.metafile'
  dev.new() is the preferred way to open a new device, in the unlikely
  event one is needed.

In my opinion this is a false positive - and a similar issue has previously been reported here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70585796/unable-to-understand-1-note-in-devtoolscheck-caused-by-a-platform-specific-d

Any ideas on how I modify the code and package submission to automatically pass the checks?

Thanks,

Wayne

Message-ID: <4406e5d0-6ad6-4b05-8b9a-34cec1d9b8c0@gmail.com>

I've spent a couple of hours with an Rmarkdown document where I
was describing some spherical coordinates made up of a radius r and
some angles. I wanted to fix the radius at 1.

In my Rmarkdown text I wrote

    Thus we have `r = 1` ...

This caused failure to render with "unexpected =". I was using Rstudio
at first and didn't see the error msg.

If I use "radius R" and `R = 1`, things are fine, or `r=1` with no space,
but the particular "(quote) r (space)" seems to trigger code block processing.

Perhaps this note can save others some wasted time.

I had thought (obviously incorrectly) that one needed ```{r something}
to start the code chunk.

A code chunk does always begin with a triple backtick at the beginning of a line. The term for what you encountered is "inline code" used to embed computed results into the markdown text as though you had typed them directly.

Check out https://www.r-bloggers.com/2017/12/how-to-show-r-inline-code-blocks-in-r-markdown for relevant discussion.

To avoid a confusion between inline code and fixed font typesetting, 
could it be

    Thus we have ` r = 1` ...

(with a space after an opening quote)?

Two suggestions:

   * let users specify the graphics device they want

   * reading manpage for dev.new() it accepts a bunch of options - there is 
probably a way to request the metafile device you want. But I could not 
find that in documentation.

Hi All,

I vaguely recall that, on CRAN, if PkgA imports PkgB, then PkgB cannot
import PkgA. (Please correct me if I am wrong.)

How about this?

PkgA imports PkgB (because PkgA has some helper functions for using PkgB)
PkgB suggests PkgA (because some vignettes or examples in PkgB use
those helpers from PkgA)

Is this allowed on CRAN?

Regards,
Shu Fai

Hi Ivan,

   Generally, I like the idea. A few comments:

   * from a package developer point of view, I would prefer to have a clear 
idea of how many threads I could use. So having a core R function like 
"getMaxThreads()" or similar would be useful. What that function returns 
could be governed by a package.

   In fact, it might be a good idea to allow to have several packages 
implementing "thread governors" for different situations.

   * it would make sense to think through whether we want (or not) to allow 
package developers to call omp_set_num_threads() or whether this is done 
by R.

   This is hairier than you might think. Allowing it forces every package 
to call omp_set_num_threads() before OMP block, because there is no way to 
know which packaged was called before.

   Not allowing to call omp_set_num_threads() might make it difficult to 
use all the threads, and force R to initialize OpenMP on startup.

  * Speaking of initialization of OpenMP, I have seen situations where 
spawning some regular pthread threads and then initializing OpenMP forces 
all pthread threads to a single CPU.

   I think this is because OpenMP sets thread affinity for all the process 
threads, but only distributes its own.

  * This also raises the question of how affinity is managed. If you have 
called makeForkCluster() to create 10 R instances and then each uses 2 
OpenMP threads, you do not want those occupying only 2 cpu execution 
threads instead of 20.

  * From the user perspective, it might be useful to be able to limit 
number of threads per package by using patterns or regular expressions.
Often, the reason for limiting number of threads is to reduce memory 
usage.

  * Speaking of memory usage, glibc has parameters like MALLOC_ARENA_MAX 
that have great impact on memory usage of multithreaded programs. I 
usually set it to 1, but then I take extra care to make as few memory 
allocation calls as possible within individual threads.

Is this allowed on CRAN?

Yes, it is. For example: testthat imports a bunch of packages to do is
thing, and those packages suggest testthat because their test suite is
based on it.

Cycles of hard dependencies (Depends, Imports) are not allowed for obvious
reasons. But packages should install and work without soft dependencies, so
there's no problem there.

Hi Vladimir,

Thanks for the suggestions. I've considered both but I can't see a way of doing what I'm trying to achieve without explicitly adding a call to win.metafile in my code.

To explain a little more...

GWSDAT is a Shiny App so we don't use the traditional R graphics device - so your suggestion #1 is not an option . Instead, the user is offered a range of different plot options in a shiny list box as illustrated here in this windows based example:
https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61183826/280452267-c4287f8d-73cc-42a3-881a-4643bdb31689.png

The list of options presented to the users in the list box is modified according to the platform - see code here:  https://github.com/WayneGitShell/GWSDAT/blob/master/R/server.R#L117-L118

So anyone using a non-windows platform will never be offered the choice of "wmf"  to begin with. For example, see the online LINUX  version, https://stats-glasgow.shinyapps.io/GWSDATV3-2/.  You will see that this option doesn't exist in the list of choices - see https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61183826/280453275-6da9b235-0387-47fd-b3a8-b0a949f0ec3e.png

Any suggestions on how I can modify this approach to make it automatically pass the CRAN checks?

Thanks,

Wayne

Two suggestions:

   * let users specify the graphics device they want

   * reading manpage for dev.new() it accepts a bunch of options - there is probably a way to request the metafile device you want. But I could not find that in documentation.

Update:

I noticed in the ggplot2 codebase they also have a call to win.metafile - see https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/blob/main/R/save.R#L280-L281

When I use grDevices::win.metafile instead of win.metafile it passes the local checks fine.

That sounds like two bugs in the check code:

1.  It complains about win.metafile even though you made its use 
conditional on being on Windows.

2.  It doesn't complain about grDevices::win.metafile.

I don't think you said, but this looks like a NOTE rather than a WARNING 
or ERROR.  I'd use the grDevices::win.metafile for now, but wouldn't be 
surprised if the NOTE turns up again later when #2 gets fixed.

Many many thanks for the clarification, which is very clear! The case
of testthat is a very good example, as many packages suggest it.

I see. Ideally, the CRAN checks should adjust to your use case - but it is 
not obvious how.

As you discovered in a later e-mail, the check just looks for the presence 
of win.metafile() so calling it in some other way satisfies the code.

Dear all,

The qrcode package converts text into a qrcode image. The opencv package is
able to convert images with a qrcode into the text. opencv has a unit test
that uses qrcode to generate a test image. Hence it lists qrcode as a
suggested package.

Would it be OK to implement the same unit test in qrcode? And thus
requiring qrcode to list opencv as a suggested package. I know this is not
allowed when depending or importing packages.

Why are these functins in two different packages?
On the surface it looks like qrcode is a transformation function and opencv is its inverse.

The goal of opencv is to provide bindings to 'OpenCV' Computer Vision
Library. Hence a much wider scope than just reading qrcodes. qrcode just
focusses creating different qrcodes. The fact that they can use each other
to test themselves is a happy coincidence.

Yes, that is allowed.  There was a thread about a related issue just a 
few days ago:  "PkgA imports PkgB, and PkgB suggests PkgA?".

Richard ... they are by different maintainers. They also are built with completely different underlying technologies... creating a bitmap is easy, deciphering one is difficult and may not be necessary in the same workflow and there may be different compiled code available optimized for different use cases (clean vs with optical interference) so it makes perfect sense to me.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] The problem with resubmitting the package to the Cran
Message-ID: <CAPzG1RQzhp38RNOaauNXEtUmzvKQ8taeGuQNpSWPEURb5FOHQg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have the following case. I would like to resubmit a package to the Cran -
per ARMA, which was archived on 2022-05-25, as it required the archived
package 'matlab'. The new version of the 'matlab' was resubmitted to the
Cran on 2022-06-01. So we would like that our package will also return to
the Cran. I didn't change anything significant in the code inside. However,
when I try to submit the package, I receive the following NOTES:

 checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE

* checking for non-standard things in the check directory ... NOTE
Found the following files/directories:
  ?PARMA21del1_ident'

I don't know really what this note mean and can I put the package
anyway to Cran?



Best regards,

Karolina

Message-ID: <3a5a605e-48dd-4c4d-a918-d62202b9f886@umb.edu>

Dear colleagues.

I'm trying to update a package on CRAN containing a dependency 
(specifically, on the popular graphing package 'plotrix') that has been 
orphaned because the maintainer is deceased.

'plotrix' is imported by well over 100 other CRAN packages, so I hope it 
is not removed from CRAN. On the other hand, I don't want to certify 
that 'I have fixed all problems shown on the package check page' if this 
is not, in fact, the case.

Can anyone comment on how one might proceed in this situation?

Thank you. -- Liam

I have a data package ?pmartRdata? hosted in a drat repository here:  https://github.com/pmartR/drat following the instructions here:  https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/drat/vignettes/DratStepByStep.html

The package installs fine via install.packages(?pmartRdata?, repos = ?https://pmartR.github.io/drat?).  I have included it under Suggests and added ?https://pmartR.github.io/drat? to the Additional_repositories field in the DESCRIPTION of a package I am submitting to CRAN.  I?m getting failures on Debian/R-devel and Windows/R-devel when running examples that use this package:

`Error in library(pmartRdata) : there is no package called ?pmartRdata?`

Checks on rhub via `rhub::check_for_cran` for ubuntu,fedora, and windows do not have this problem.  What do I need to do to get it to install on CRAN submission machines?

Best,
-Daniel Claborne

You'll need to fix that note before resubmitting. If you can share a
link to a public repository, people in this list will likely be able to
help.

Dear Liam,
I don't understand your question: if your package has plotrix listed as a
dependency, it won't affect plotrix.
Only the opposite would be true. Could you please clarify and indicate
which package you are referring to?
Thanks,
Alex

Dear Karolina,
It means that you have an unexpected file or folder called
"PARMA21del1_ident" inside your package.
So either remove it or list it in a file called .Rbuildignore which you
place at the root of the package folder.
Best,
Alex

Apparently you create this file during the checks. So examples or 
vignette code executed by users may write it into the user filespace. 
You must not write their by default nor in examples etc.
Let the user choose the filename and otherwise, e.g., in examples, use 
tempdir() as a location for writing files.

Uwe Ligges

Generally, you cannot assume that suggested package is available on CRAN 
(or any other) machine. Instead, you have to put the code involving 
suggested package inside an 'if()' clause, like:

if (requireNamespace("pkg", quietly=TRUE) {

 ?? pkg::do_something()

}

Serguei.

My apologies for the lack of clarity.

plotrix has been orphaned so my package results page now says

 ??? checking package dependencies ... WARNING
 ??? Requires orphaned package: ?plotrix?

CRAN incoming requires maintainers to certify: 'I have fixed all 
problems shown on the package check page.' Since I can't unorphan 
plotrix, I can't certify this statement & thus can't get a new version 
of my package on CRAN. Advice on how to proceed is welcomed.

The CRAN team has already updated it once [1], fixing a number of Rd
problems to ensure that it stays on CRAN for now and thus avoiding the
immediate damage to the ecosystem, but eventually, someone interested
in keeping this package working will have to step up and become the new
maintainer.

My interpretation is that while your packages still depend on plotrix,
this counts as a major problem. Can you make it at least an optional
dependency?

Orphaned packages can't be listed in DEPENDS and IMPORTS fields in file DESCRIPTION. They can be in SUGGESTS but calls of functions from them should be guarded, eg with a message to install the offending package. In examples and tests the usage should be conditional on the package being installed.

Another option is to take over maintenance of that package. In your case, with so many dependencies someone may be working on bringing it back.

Thank you Georgi & Ivan for your comments.

Because of the way 'plotrix' is written, it turns out to be very easy to 
copy the imported functions into a new source file in my package (let's 
say, plotrix_fn.R) and remove the dependency.

What I've actually done is move 'plotrix' to Suggests, and then have R 
check to see if plotrix is installed to determine which version of each 
function to use. E.g.:

 ??? arctext<-if(.check.pkg("plotrix")) plotrix::arctext else Arctext

in which 'arctext' is the function name exported by plotrix and Arctext 
is the copy in my package.

I believe this is permitted under GPL-3. Can someone with more 
experience in this recommend how the original authors of plotrix should 
be properly credited?

Thanks again for this constructive feedback.

All the best, Liam

I have volunteered to take over maintenance of plotrix.  I should be 
submitting a version without the "orphaned" designation soon.

(If anyone else would rather be maintainer, please get in touch with me 
offline.)

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Note to repository maintainers about ABI change in
 Matrix 1.6-2
Message-ID: <95f67c1e-ff07-4982-a185-a30f0f905868@gmail.com>

For repositories != CRAN:

Matrix 1.6-2 was released on Nov 8.  Due to an ABI change, repositories
maintaining R package binaries should ensure that binaries for the first
order reverse LinkingTo of Matrix are rebuilt under Matrix 1.6-2:


 > db <- available.packages(repos = "https://cran.r-project.org/")
 > tools::package_dependencies("Matrix", db = db, which = "LinkingTo", reverse = 
TRUE)[[1L]]
  [1] "ahMLE"               "bayesWatch"          "cplm"
  [4] "GeneralizedWendland" "geostatsp"           "hibayes"
  [7] "irlba"               "lme4"                "mcmcsae"
[10] "OpenMx"              "PRIMME"              "robustlmm"
[13] "spGARCH"             "TMB"


Typically, ABI changes occur only rarely, when Matrix updates the internal
SuiteSparse libraries and _those_ libraries change _their_ ABI.  This case
is an exception: we discovered that certain function prototypes in our
headers were inconsistent with corresponding prototypes in the SuiteSparse
headers, and the "consistent" prototypes were not binary compatible.

It is for this reason (and others) that Matrix has begun versioning its ABI,
as I announced in an earlier thread on R-SIG-Mac:

     https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/2023-October/014890.html

That (in addition to future, more proactive announcements on mailing lists)
should allow repository maintainers to adapt sooner going forward.

'matlab'. The new version of the 'matlab' was resubmitted to the Cran on
2022-06-01. When I try to submit the package, I receive the following
NOTES:

 Checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE

* checking for non-standard things in the check directory ... NOTE
Found the following files/directories:
  ?PARMA21del1_ident'

This time I put also the link to the repository on github:
https://github.com/Klona9/r-perARMA.git
gh repo clone Klona9/r-perARMA


I will be very glad for any help.

Best regards,

Karolina

Your examples for `parma_ident` appear to create a directory named 
"PARMA21del1_ident" below the current directory.  You can't create files 
there, you need to create them in tempdir().

The following additional packages were found to have stale SClassExtension
objects cached in their namespaces:

     MatrixModels, SeuratObject, softImpute

and so their binaries should be rebuilt also.

Good day development team, I trust this email finds you well.

I am trying to upload a package onto CRAN. Note that this is a second
version of an existing package on CRAN, called iopspackage. I have built
the package using the R CMD build function and checked the function using R
CMD check --as cran--. The check yields 3 notes. 2 of them are regarding
run time and big file sizes, which is expected and I can't fix since it is
external functions used in my package that take that much time and a big
example file required. The 3rd note I do not know how to solve. I submitted
this file but it did not pass the automatic checks. Please see the part
from the CRAN-submission email below, as well as my attached .tar.gz file.
Any assistance to get this package open-source uploaded to CRAN would be
appreciated, thank you!

Kind regards
Christiaan

You will have to fix the run time.  Try running the example on a smaller 
dataset, or don't run it at all (by putting it in \donttest{}). The file 
size may be acceptable to CRAN; you will need to make an argument to 
them in your upload.

The note about the "\_" entries comes from "country\_codes\_V202201" 
(and similar).  That's not legal Rd syntax.  You could use 
"\code{country_codes_V202201}" or some other verbatim wrapper.

I see a 4th note, about files Combined_Results.csv and 
Combined_Results.xlsx.  If those files are produced by an example or 
test, they should be in tempdir().

I highly recommend to find a way to replace the 50-megabyte
inst/extdata/ExampleTradeData.csv with a smaller file. CRAN policy [*]
says "As a general rule, neither data nor documentation should exceed
5MB", and your package tarball mostly consists of example data.

Not sure why roxygen2 is generating these for you. Maybe you need to
update roxygen2 to a newer version that doesn't generate
country\_codes\_V202201 from country_codes_V202201 and run roxygenise()
again. Duncan's idea to encode these as \code{} (or maybe \verb{} if
it's not intended to be R code) is also good.

CRAN policy says: "Checking the package should take as little CPU time
as possible". Once you make a smaller example file, it will probably be
also faster to process.

The examples in the help pages are not only for R CMD check to run and
for CRAN to complain about; they are also present in the package for
the user to run example(IOPS) and see it in action. As a user, I would
probably get bored and interrupt your example if it takes more than 2
minutes to run.
 
> Check: for non-standard things in the check directory, Result: NOTE
>   Found the following files/directories:

"Packages should not write <...> anywhere <...> on the file system apart
from the R session?s temporary directory"

As a user, I would prefer example(IOPS) to modify as little of my
environment as possible. If I had valuable data saved as
"Combined_Results.csv" in the current directory, example(IOPS) would
have overwritten this file. As already pointed out by Duncan Murdoch,
the example will have to create its files under tempdir() and remove
them after it's done.

These are not the only problems you need to fix. Currently, your code
begins by loading a number of packages:

> #requireNamespace("roxygen2")
> requireNamespace("Rcpp")
> requireNamespace("dplyr")
> requireNamespace("tidyr")
> #requireNamespace("readxl")
> requireNamespace("economiccomplexity")
> requireNamespace("usethis")
> requireNamespace("Matrix")
> requireNamespace("tibble")
> requireNamespace("openxlsx")
> requireNamespace("utils")
> #requireNamespace("stats")
> 
> library("Rcpp")
> library("tidyr")
> library("dplyr")
> library("readxl")
> library("economiccomplexity")
> library("usethis")
> library("roxygen2")
> library("openxlsx")
This doesn't play well with the package dependency mechanism. You
should specify which functions you export, import individual functions
or whole packages in the NAMESPACE file [**]. Since you're using
roxygen2, you can use the @importFrom tag to declare your dependencies,
and it will generate the NAMESPACE file for you. Packages shouldn't be
calling library(), and for any optional dependencies, the return value
of requireNamespace() should be checked.

> if( ComplexMethod == "reflections"&& ComplexMethod == "eigenvalues" &&
> ComplexMethod == "fitness") stop('Invalid complexity method')
You probably meant to say !(condition || condition || condition)
instead of condition && condition && condition here. You can also use
the built-in R function stopifnot() as a shorthand for validating
various conditions. switch() with a default stop() and/or match.args()
is also an option.

> CorrectCountryNr <- readline("Please enter correct country
> (corresponding integer): ")
You will probably want to condition this on interactive() and transform
this into an error when the R session is running in batch mode,
unattended. There is not enough error checking after readline() (what
if the user makes a typo?). The menu() function can do most of this for
you.

Good luck, and I hope your next version of the package gets accepted!

Message-ID: <961109932.9036169.1699889985884.JavaMail.zimbra@u-bordeaux.fr>

Hi everyone, 

I sent a first message a few weeks ago. I'm still in trouble for sending a package (Frailtypack) on the CRAN. It was removed because of reinforcement in CRAN requirements. 
We corrected the few issues, but more appeared, and one that I'm still enable to correct. 

Here is the error message, and the adequate code part is joint in the mail : 

error: loc("/data/gannet/ripley/R/packages/incoming/frailtypack.Rcheck/00_pkg_src/frailtypack/src/Integrale_mult_scl.f90":1811:17): 'omp.reduction' op must be used within an operation supporting reduction clause interface 
error: verification of lowering to FIR failed 

I've already received precious help, that indicated me that the error probably comes from the flang-new compiler used by the CRAN (He replicated the error, I send you the code he made in attachment too : test_fortran.f90). 
I tried the code portion with other compilers (gfortran), and the error didn't appear. 

Nevertheless, It may be a compiler error, the CRAN keeps denying the package. 

Does anyone have a solution, to avoid this error please ? 

Thanks a lot for your answers ! 

Romain Pierlot

If you are sufficiently confident this is a compiler bug, it would be 
great if you could submit a bug report for LLVM/flang-new, so that it 
could be fixed. You would also likely get feedback this way confirming 
whether it really is a compiler bug or a problem in your code. And if it 
is a confirmed bug, you might even get an advice for a work-around for 
older compilers.

An issue has already been sent on the GitHub page of llvm for 2 weeks : https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/70828

But even if it is a compiler bug, as many people are waiting for my package, it would be nice to find a way to avoid the bug in order to sent it on the CRAN.

Any advice ? 

Thanks, 

Romain Pierlot

Have you tried explaining this in the package submission comment? What
was the response? Does the reviewer need more evidence? Linking to the
LLVM issue on GitHub and/or the previous R-package-devel thread may
help.

(LLVM giveth and LLVM taketh away. While I'm sure that their
diagnostics helped improve many packages, I have encountered a few
places in the R code where clang suggested to replace boolean
expressions && and || with bitwise operations & and |. The code still
works, but now relies on boolean constants having certain exact bits
set. Replace a 1 with a 2 and things will break.)

It might be the case that CRAN cannot afford to make an exception for
this compiler bug. I can imagine a number of workarounds:

1. In your ./configure script, check for the Fortran compiler being
flang-new version 17. If the check succeeds, disable OpenMP altogether.

2. Rewrite your Fortran code so that a variable is never touched before
it is used in an OpenMP reduction. You may have to declare a new
variable for every OpenMP reduction loop inside a function.

If you don't succeed in convincing CRAN regarding the compiler bug,
which one of the two workarounds would you prefer?

We indicated the possible bug in the comment section, with a link on the GitHub issue. 
They didn't consider this, and just refused the package, sending us the .log file explaining the issue on .omp reduction.

>1. In your ./configure script, check for the Fortran compiler being

How can I do that ? I can create a .configure file on the root folder, but how do I check the compiler version ? As in .R file, with FC = ... ? And what about OpenMP deactivation ?

I'll try this, thanks. I'm still unable to install flang-new on my device, as it is too voluminate and my computer systematically crash. So i'll do the changes and send it on CRAN, hopefully it'll be ok. 


Many thanks for all your help !

Sorry about that. Was there an option to reply and explain? I once
argued my way out of a rejection after I explained a mistake on the
reviewer's part, but one has to be careful not to take too much time
from one of the seven people keeping ~20000 packages working.

Let's do the workaround then.

#!/bin/sh
# taken from Writing R Extensions, 1.2. Configure and cleanup
: ${R_HOME=`R RHOME`}
if test -z "${R_HOME}"; then
  echo "could not determine R_HOME"
  exit 1
fi
# determine the Fortran compiler
FC="`"${R_HOME}/bin/R" CMD config FC`"
# Use --version output to determine the compiler
# A different compiler will either accept --version and print something
# else or fail due to "unknown argument". In both cases the branch will
# not be taken
if "$FC" --version 2>/dev/null | grep -q 'flang-new version 17'; then
 # deactivate OpenMP, see below
fi

> And what about OpenMP deactivation ? 

In your src/Makevars, you use Make variables SHLIB_OPENMP_FFLAGS and
SHLIB_OPENMP_CFLAGS to enable OpenMP support. The configure script can
edit this file in various ways, for example, setting the variables to
an empty string:

echo 'SHLIB_OPENMP_FFLAGS =' >>src/Makevars
echo 'SHLIB_OPENMP_CFLAGS =' >>src/Makevars

This is untested, but should work.

I think that workaround (1) should be easier to test (you can try
disabling OpenMP when the Fortran compiler is gfortran, verify that it
works, then switch the test to detect flang-new which you don't have
installed), but if you're more comfortable editing Fortran code, (2)
should also be viable.

I would definitely look for a work-around. In the end we want to give 
users software that works, rather than something that doesn't, but 
telling them, possibly with good evidence, than it is not our fault.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Trouble with greek letter in figure title in R-devel
Message-ID: <479d4edf-9eea-4f51-acb3-06d61ccd9fa5@bht-berlin.de>

Dear package developers,

I am struggling with an error on R devel (all flavors) that I cannot 
reproduce with a freshly installed R-devel on my machine: Function 
halfnormal in package DoE.base places the greek letter alpha in the 
title of a figure. I changed the code to using plotmath about a month 
ago (on CRAN request), and everything seemed fine then. Now, however, 
R-devel produces an error message 
(https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-devel-windows-x86_64/DoE.base-00check.html):

Error in title(...) :
 ??conversion failure on 'Plot for rnorm.12., method = Lenth, ? = 0.05' 
in 'mbcsToSbcs': for ? (U+03B1)
Calls: halfnormal ... <Anonymous> -> plot -> plot.default -> localTitle 
-> title
Execution halted

CRAN threaten to archive the package because of that error - so I would 
really appreciate help on finding out what I should do (apart from nasty 
things like writing alpha instead of using the greek letter).

The code in function halfnormal that creates the title in question looks 
as follows:

 ? ## added August 1 5 2014, modified Oct 17 2023
 ? if (is.null(titel)){
 ???? titel <- as.expression(bquote("Plot for "*.(xnam)*", "*alpha == 
.(alpha)))
 ???? dots$main <- titel
 ? }

The list dots is later used in "do.call(plotfun, dots)".

Any recommendations?

Thanks and regards,
Ulrike

Yes, and your code contains

      titel <- bquote(paste("Plot for ", paste(xnam), ", method = ", 
.(method),
      ", \U03B1 = ", .(alpha), sep=""))


So please change this to plotmath as in the instance further above in 
your code where you already wrote

     titel <- as.expression(bquote("Plot for "*.(xnam)*", "*alpha == 
.(alpha)))


Best,
Uwe Ligges

Thank you for spotting this, I should have found it myself :-(
I suppose I don't get this error even from latest R-devel because of the 
settings of my Windows system?

Not sure if it is yet part of the --as-cran checks.
But you can set the env var

  _R_CHECK_MBCS_CONVERSION_FAILURE_=true

Best,
Uwe

Greetings,
Suppose I wanted to develop a package with C++ code that contains virtual functions which the package user should define.It's assumed that evaluation is expensive so we do not want to define these in R and then call these R-functions from C++.
Is this a reasonable idea with a standard solution?Are there packages that do this?
Thanks in advance for all answers,?

I think you would be better off having your package evaluate R 
functions.  If that's too slow, the user could use Rcpp or hand 
programming to put most of the computation into C++ or C code.

It seems unlikely the overhead of passing the results from the user's 
C++ code through R would be significant if the computations themselves 
were slow.  On the other hand, the user has the opportunity of 
prototyping in R, which may turn out to be fast enough.

To get the prototyping possibility with your approach, you'd need to 
write and maintain two interfaces:  C++ to C++ and C++ to R.

One situation where this might be worth the trouble would be if you 
expect the user's function to be fast, but your code needs to call it a 
huge number of times, so the overhead adds up.

Hm, virtual C++ functions are defined at compilation time. Their binding 
is done at runtime but at compilation time they must be already defined. 
So, how a package user (who already installed and therefor compiled your 
package) could define them? Moreover in R?
Or may be you mean that a user import your C++ code and define his own 
derived function based on your virtual functions in his C++ code?
Or, another option, you call "virtual function" what is usually called 
"callback function" like e.g. a function searching for roots of any user 
defined function and taking it as a parameter. This latter is a callback 
function.

Could you precise what you mean by "virtual function" and "package user 
should define"?

Best,
Serguei.

Not sure if I understand what you are after, but the small
RcppXPtrUtils package may be helpful. It provides two things: a
utility to compile and wrap a C++ function provided by the user, and
another one to check that the signature is correct. See:
https://gallery.rcpp.org/articles/passing-cpp-function-pointers-rcppxptrutils/

Thanks for all replies. I think the idea of a callback and link to RcppXPtrUtils is pointing me in the right direction.

Hi Simon,

We use C++20 'inside' our library and C++17 in the API. Part of our C++17 use
is now expanding to std::filesystem whose availability is dependent on the
implementation. 

The compiler tells us (in a compilation using -mmacosx-version-min=10.14)
that the features we want are only available with 10.15.

Would we be allowed to use this value of '10.15' on CRAN?

Thanks as always,  Dirk

Dirk,

can you clarify where the flags come from? The current CRAN builds (big-sur-x86_64 and big-sur-arm64) use

export SDKROOT=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX11.sdk
export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=11.0

so the lowest target is 11.0 and it is no longer forced it in the flags (so that users can more easily choose their desired targets).

Cheers,
Simon

Beautiful, solves our issue.  Was that announced at some point? If so, where?

For reference the R-on-macOS FAQ I consulted still talks about 10.13 at
https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/RMacOSX-FAQ.html#Installation-of-source-packages

  CC = clang -mmacosx-version-min=10.13
  CXX = clang++ -mmacosx-version-min=10.13 -std=gnu++14
  FC = gfortran -mmacosx-version-min=10.13
  OBJC = clang -mmacosx-version-min=10.13
  OBJCXX = clang++ -mmacosx-version-min=10.13

so someone may want to refresh this. It is what I consulted as relevant info.

Thanks, Dirk

I don't see what is there to announce as the packages should be simply using flags passed from R and that process did not change.

That said, the binary target for CRAN has been announced on this list as part of the big-sur build announcement:

It says "Look at file /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/etc/Makeconf" so it is just an example that will vary by build. For example big-sur-arm64 will give you

$ grep -E '^(CC|CXX|FC|OBJC|OBJCXX) ' /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/etc/Makeconf
CC = clang -arch arm64
CXX = clang++ -arch arm64 -std=gnu++14
FC = /opt/R/arm64/bin/gfortran -mtune=native
OBJC = clang -arch arm64
OBJCXX = clang++ -arch arm64

Again, this is just an example, no one should be entering such flags by hand - that's why they are in Makeconf so packages can use them without worrying about the values (see R-exts 1.2: https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Configure-and-cleanup for details).

I don't own or (directly) use macOS hardware so I am not on that list.

| It says "Look at file /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/etc/Makeconf" so it is just an example that will vary by build. For example big-sur-arm64 will give you
| 
| $ grep -E '^(CC|CXX|FC|OBJC|OBJCXX) ' /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/etc/Makeconf
| CC = clang -arch arm64

| FC = /opt/R/arm64/bin/gfortran -mtune=native
| OBJC = clang -arch arm64
| OBJCXX = clang++ -arch arm64
| 
| Again, this is just an example, no one should be entering such flags by hand - that's why they are in Makeconf so packages can use them without worrying about the values (see R-exts 1.2: https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Configure-and-cleanup for details).

I recommend you spend a moment with for example the (rather handy) search
capability of GitHub to search through the 'cran' organisation mirroring the
repo.  The package I maintain is far from being the only one setting the flag.

This code looks like it shouldn't be working as written. I don't see
the variable temp_dir being defined anywhere, so it should have failed
with Error: object 'temp_dir' not found. Have you run roxygenise() in
order to generate the man/*.Rd files (which is what R cares about)?

It's best to avoid changing the global state of the application,
including the current directory. When you have to setwd(), do it the
following way:

oldwd. <- setwd(...)
# do the thing
setwd(oldwd.)

In my opinion, it's better to provide an argument for your function to
let the user specify the destination file. This would let the user say
IOPS(outfile = 'Combined_Results_2.xlsx') without overwriting the
Combined_Results.xlsx that already exists or even outfile =
file.path(tempdir(), 'whatever.xlsx') to put the file into another
directory. I think you will also need to remove that file at the end of
your example. (Cleaning the whole tempdir(), on the other hand, could
be bad for the user.)

22 seconds is much better!

How much time is spent in read.csv(system.file("extdata",
"ExampleTradeData.csv", package = "iopspackage"))? Can you resave it
under data/*.rda, load it using data() and save some time there?

If you cannot squeeze your data even further, it may help to profile
the example(IOPS) run [1] and try to find faster alternatives for the
parts of the code that take the most time. It's not exactly trivial
(make sure to read both WRE 3.2 and help(Rprof)), but it should be
possible to improve your time.

Simon,

One more thing: An alert reader pointed out to me that macOS-oldrel has

 r-oldrel-macos-x86_64	r-oldrel	macOS	x86_64	macOS 10.13.6 (17G11023)

in the table at https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_flavors.html. So
this seems to mesh with what the R-on-macOS FAQ says, and switching to 11.0
would appear to at least loose r-oldrel-macos-x86_64 until April, no?

Best,  Dirk

Hi all, thank you for your feedback and help! I apologise for the big
attachment.

I have made the changes you suggested but am still encountering some of the
same notes, If you do not mind to assist me again I would greatly
appreciate!

I reduced the example file to a 3 KB file, hoping that it would reduce my
runtime, but I still received this note:
* checking examples ... [26s] NOTE
Examples with CPU (user + system) or elapsed time > 5s
      user system elapsed
IOPS 15.23   2.89   22.41
Is there any other way to reduce this time? I have gone through my code and
can't find any areas to change that will help this.

Then the 2nd and 3rd notes relate to the example and its outputs. I do not
know how to fix this.
* checking for non-standard things in the check directory ... NOTE
Found the following files/directories:
  'Combined_Results.csv' 'Combined_Results.xlsx'
* checking for detritus in the temp directory ... NOTE
Found the following files/directories:
  'lastMiKTeXException'

I have changed my code to include the tempdir() as suggested before but it
doesn't seem to work. I then tried to use the \donttest{} method also
suggested before. I don't know if I am doing this wrong.
Here is my updated example code:

#' @examples
#' \donttest{
#'
#' # Set the working directory to a temporary directory
#' setwd(tempdir())
#'
#' # Load the example data
#' ExampleTradeData <- read.csv(system.file("extdata",
"ExampleTradeData.csv", package = "iopspackage"))
#'
#'
#' # Then use it in your function
#' IOPS(
#'   CountryCode = 710,
#'   tradeData = ExampleTradeData,
#'   ComplexMethod = "reflections",
#'   iterCompl = 5,
#'   GVCMapping = NULL,
#'   tradedigit = 6
#' )
#'
#' # Clean up the temporary directory
#' unlink(temp_dir, recursive = TRUE)
#' }
#'

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated
Christiaan

Message-ID: <CAA8crwe=Ahry5kf_x6P1HXJ5coAZRfZJyv=arJUhVq0nm1khDA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello:

About three weeks ago, I received a message that a CRAN package I maintain
(ggenealogy) had issues with "Unicode chars not available to pdf()".

As shown here
<https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-clang/ggenealogy-00check.html>,
it seems ERRORs occur when building the vignette, such as:

1) conversion failure on 'Lubom?r Kub??ek' in 'mbcsToSbcs': for ? (U+010D)
2) conversion failure on 'Anders ?gren' in 'mbcsToSbcs': for ? (U+00C5)

I have attempted to add lines such as:

1) pdf.options(encoding='ISOLatin2.enc') to the vignettes/ggenealogy.Rnw
file
2) set_null_device("cairo") to the vignettes/ggenealogy.Rnw file (this
gives me a "could not find function "set_null_device"" ERROR)

I have been a bit stuck on how to resolve these new issues. A few days ago,
I noticed my package was removed from CRAN before the stated deadline AoE
(Anywhere on Earth), and so I decided to upload all changes I had made up
until that point into a new ggenealogy_1.0.2.tar.gz file to the CRAN
submission website. However, it seems the problem remain, and so I'm now
reaching out to the list-serve to see if this may help me resolve the
issues in a timely manner.

Thank you for your patience and guidance.

Kind regards,
LAR

I don't think this function from the cowplot package would have helped.
You are compiling a LaTeX vignette, so you need to produce a PDF plot
to include in the rendered PDF vignette.

> 1) pdf.options(encoding='ISOLatin2.enc') to the
> vignettes/ggenealogy.Rnw file

Something like this should help. Here's how I can reproduce the problem
on latest R-devel:

Sys.setenv('_R_CHECK_MBCS_CONVERSION_FAILURE_' = 'TRUE')
pdf()
graphics::strwidth('Lubom?r Kub??ek', "inches")
# Error in graphics::strwidth("Lubom?r Kub??ek", "inches") :
#   conversion failure on 'Lubom?r Kub??ek' in 'mbcsToSbcs': for ?
#   (U+00ED)

Notably, the error is absent if I either call
pdf.options(encoding='ISOLatin2.enc') before pdf() or replace pdf()
with the better-Unicode-equipped cairo_pdf().

As a workaround, you could use the latter device in your vignette by
following section "Custom Graphics Devices" of help(RweaveLatex) (or
section 4.1.5 "Graphics devices" of the Sweave vignette):

<<results=hide,echo=FALSE>>=
my.Swd <- function(name, width, height, ...)
 grDevices::cairo_pdf(
  filename = paste(name, "pdf", sep = "."),
  width = width, height = height
 )
@
\SweaveOpts{grdevice=my.Swd,pdf=FALSE}

With this in the document, the following chunk doesn't crash
_R_CHECK_MBCS_CONVERSION_FAILURE_=TRUE R-devel CMD Sweave:

<<fig=TRUE>>=
# NB: fig=TRUE must be set, otherwise R calls pdf() with default options
graphics::strwidth('Lubom?r Kub??ek', "inches")
@

So why doesn't it help to call pdf.options() in a Sweave chunk? My
guess is that's too late for Sweave to pick it up by the time it's
weaving a vignette, but RweaveLatex presents an alternative way of
setting the option:

\SweaveOpts{pdf.encoding = ISOLatin2.enc}

With this in the vignette, my previous example also avoids the crash.

Good luck!

The tarball I have fished from CRAN says version 0.2.0, but your GitHub
repo <https://github.com/asadow/megamation/> says version 0.1.0.
(For best results, help us to help you by showing the source code.) Have
you submitted this package to CRAN before? Did it previously contain a
test that ran mm_authorize(overwrite = TRUE)?

This is incredibly weird, but since your examples don't seem to run
Sys.setenv() and have never ran mm_authorize(), my only low-probability
guess is that the .Renviron changes from mm_authorize(overwrite = TRUE)
in your tests/testthat/test-authorize.R turned out to persist from the
check run of the previous version of your package.

It may be a better idea to make use of tools::R_user_dir() in
mm_authorize() and the rest of the package (and to be much more careful
when unit-testing this function: changing user files and other global
state in tests and examples is against CRAN policy) and leave
~/.Renviron for the user to edit.

> 2. I see the example printed twice with strange formatting?

This is how @examplesIf works: it wraps your code in if (condition)
withAutoprint { your code }. The first time is R echoing the source
code back; the second time is R printing every line of the

Dear Ivan,

Thank you for explaining in such depth. I had not submitted to CRAN before.
I will look into tools::R_user_dir().

- May you point me toward the policy that the package should not edit
.Renviron? I thought I was following best practices, but maybe things have
changed. For instance, this package changes the .Renvrion GitHub -
ropensci/qualtRics: Download ?? Qualtrics survey data directly into R!
<https://github.com/ropensci/qualtRics> with the difference being that they
do not use withr::defer().

- It occured to me I need skip_on_cran() for the test "mm_authorize() sets
credentials". That is because testing_key(), which refers to an env var, is
not available on CRAN.  Even without testing_key(), the test
"mm_authorize() sets credentials" does not error. It gives a message

-- Skip (Line 4): mm_authorize() sets credentials ------------------------------


Reason: Can't find envvar MEGAMATION_KEY_HTTR2


but since CMD check does not print this as a NOTE, and testthat does not
print it either, I was unaware of it.

Best,
Adam

It is the policy you have agreed to when submitting your package to CRAN:

"CRAN Repository Policy
[...]
The code and examples provided in a package should never do anything which might be regarded as malicious or anti-social. The following are illustrative examples from past experience.
[...]
 - Packages should not write in the user?s home filespace (including clipboards), nor anywhere else on the file system apart from the R session?s temporary directory. [...]
  For R version 4.0 or later (hence a version dependency is required or only conditional use is possible), packages may store user-specific data, configuration and cache files in their respective user directories obtained from tools::R_user_dir(), provided that by default sizes are kept as small as possible and the contents are actively managed (including removing outdated material).
"

Simon

Thank you dearly, Simon, for pointing out the policy. May a test do the
following?

1. Save the user's original value for env var X.
2. Write a new value for env var X during a test.
3. Write back the original value for env var X at the end of the test.

An example:

test_that("mm_authorize() sets credentials", {
  skip_on_cran()
  key_original <- mm_key()
  url_original <- mm_url()
  withr::defer({
    mm_authorize(
      key = key_original,
      url = url_original,
      overwrite = TRUE
    )
  })
  mm_authorize(
    key = "1",
    url = "https://api.megamation.com/uw/joe/",
    overwrite = TRUE
  )
  expect_false(
    endsWith(Sys.getenv("MEGAMATION_URL"), "/")
  )
})

Adam,

no, it is your code in mm_authorize() that violates the CRAN policy, it is not about the test. You may not touch user's .Renviron and there is no reason to resort to such drastic measures. If you want to cache user's credentials, you have to do it in a file located via tools::R_user_dir().

Cheers,
Simon

Rather than using tools::R_user_dir(), you can also ask the user for a path where they would like to save the information to. This allows you to test it with a temporary directory file, but would allow the user to specify their .Renviron file, if they so choose. This acts as a middle ground?managing a separate package-specific file and storing it as an environmental variable. This is how I approach it in a handful of packages, including `feltr` (see https://github.com/christopherkenny/feltr/blob/HEAD/R/felt_key.R) and `bskyr` (see https://github.com/christopherkenny/bskyr/blob/main/R/auth_user.R).

For what it's?worth, some of this confusion may come from a relatively recent change in interpretation of the policy mentioned below by Simon (even though the text has long read that way). For years, CRAN allowed packages which had the practice of opting into writing to the default .Renviron file. That old reading comports with the example you point to in qualtRics, where the writing is controlled by the `install` argument, with a default of FALSE. Since sometime in the last year, the interpretation was updated and you are now met with a message from the volunteer which states:
"Please ensure that your functions do not write by default or in your examples/vignettes/tests in the user's home filespace (including the package directory and getwd()). This is not allowed by CRAN policies.
Please omit any default path in writing functions. In your examples/vignettes/tests you can write to tempdir()."

The approach used in `feltr` and other packages to explicitly require a path as an argument appears to be okay with the new reading of the policy. (At least, the CRAN volunteers seem to accept packages which use this approach.)

Best,
Chris

The package contains both C and Fortran code and in the criteria.c there is only a sprintf use, as follows:

sprintf(msg,"criteria: error (%d) -> %s\n", inErr, errStr);
Rf_error(msg);
May be the reason of the warning the next line the ?Writing R Extensions? manual?

> Use ofsprintfandvsprintfis regarded as a potential security risk and warned about on some platforms.[82](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#FOOT82)R CMD checkreports if any calls are found.

If that is the reason, is there any alternative to the use of sprintf? Anyway, what can I do?

Thanks you in advance for your time.

Kind regards,
Iago

Yes, the reason for the error is the use of sprintf. You can instead use
snprintf where n is the maximum number of bytes to write, including the
terminating nul character. For example:

char msg[8191];
snprintf(msg, 8191, "criteria: error (%d) -> %s\n", inErr, errStr);
Rf_error(msg);

or however large you made the error string.

Thank you, Chris. I plan to explore the method you described as simply
removing the authorize function would be a shame. Your description of the
past was certainly worthwhile and enlightening.

Rf_error() takes format arguments like sprintf(). It should be possible to call:

Rf_error("criteria: error (%d) -> %s", inErr, errStr);

Chris,

this was not a change in interpretation, but rather CRAN's tools have gotten better at detecting such bad behavior.

I would like to point out that there is absolutely no reason to mangle user's .Renviron since the package can always set any environment variables it needs from its (legally managed) configuration files (as described in the policy) on load.

Regarding the approach you suggested, personally, I think it is bad - no package should be touching personal configuration files - it's entirely unnecessary and dangerous (e.g., your code will happily remove the content of the file on write error losing all user's values - that's why you never write important files directly, but rather create a copy which you atomically move in place *after* you know the content is correct).

Cheers,
Simon

This allows you to test it with a temporary directory file, but would allow the user to specify their .Renviron file, if they so choose. This acts as a middle ground managing a separate package-specific file and storing it as an environmental variable.

Hello Ivan:

Thank you for your helpful response here.

I added the code you suggested to the package vignette:







*<<echo=FALSE>>=my.Swd <- function(name, width, height,
...) grDevices::cairo_pdf(  filename = paste(name, "pdf", sep = "."),
width = width, height = height )@*

This particular code did not seem to negatively affect the vignette
production. R CMD check seemed to pass on my local machine. And running the
vignette line-by-line on my local machine (even after setting:
*Sys.setenv('_R_CHECK_MBCS_CONVERSION_FAILURE_'
= 'TRUE')*) did not cause any errors and successfully produced plots.

R CMD check also seems to pass with only one NOTE when I ran it on the
"Debian Linux, R-devel, GCC" (by using the rhub::check("ggenealogy",
platform = "debian-gcc-devel") in my local RStudio) (
https://builder.r-hub.io/status/original/ggenealogy_1.0.3.tar.gz-9ffea1329d0b485eb9019dbf035a69f5)
and when I ran it on "Debian Linux, R-devel, clang, ISO-8859-15 locale" (by
using the rhub::check("ggenealogy", platform = "debian-clang-devel") in my
local RStudio) (
https://builder.r-hub.io/status/original/ggenealogy_1.0.3.tar.gz-58e271ac7d2144aaab035cf7c5d9f879
).

In both those cases, I didn't see the ERROR of "Conversion failure in
'mbcsToSbcs'".

So, I created a new .tar file and uploaded it to the CRAN submission site.
However, I received another response that my package had errors (
https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/ggenealogy_1.0.3_20231118_121231/Debian/00check.log),
which does show the "conversion failure on 'Lubom?r Kub??ek' in
'mbcsToSbcs': for ? (U+010D)" ERROR.

I'm a bit unsure why this ERROR is still persisting, and how to
troubleshoot it. I am unable to replicate it on my local machine. Do you
have any suggestions how I can resolve this issue based on this latest
update?

Thank you again for your advice and patience.

Kind regards,
LAR

You have this directive commented out a few lines later, inside a code
block. It should instead be present outside the code block, without a %
before it.

(It's best to link to a copy of the code available for viewing
somewhere. While I was able to fish out a copy of your package from the
CRAN FTP server this time, it is not always possible to do so.)

A less intrusive way to avoid the error is using the following Sweave
directive:

\SweaveOpts{pdf.encoding = ISOLatin2.enc}

(Without changing the plot device or creating a new plot device in a
hidden code block.)

In order to replicate the problem, you need (1) a fairly recent R-devel
(a pre-release version, e.g. [*]) and (2) the environment variable
_R_CHECK_MBCS_CONVERSION_FAILURE_ set. R-hub runs recent R-devel but
doesn't set the environment variable. I don't know for sure, but I
think that you are running a released version of R. I hope that R-core
will make this test part of R CMD check --as-cran, making it possible
to reproduce such failures with just a copy of R-devel, without extra
environment variables.

This line should be

snprintf(msg, 8190, "criteria: error (%d) -> %s\n", inErr, errStr);

i.e. 1-less than 'msg' size, leaving a room for the terminal 0-byte.
Otherwise, a recent version of gcc emits a warning caught by CRAN.

Best,
Serguei.

The n in snprintf includes the room for the terminating nul. It should be
8191. If gcc is throwing a warning, it can be ignored.

Yes, indeed  ' - 1 ',

but really  Iago    (and everyone else!) should in such cases
use the much nicer and easier code that  Ivan Krylov proposed
yesterday :

   Rf_error("criteria: error (%d) -> %s", inErr, errStr);

with *no* need of declaring a `msg` buffer and thinking about
its size.

Hi all,

While we're on the topic of BLAS thread handling, there's also the 
matter of OpenBLAS's two threading implementations. Depending on how the 
library is built, it can either use OpenMP or it can use POSIX threading.

This can cause issues in packages that call into BLAS functions in an 
OpenMP block as the POSIX threading variant will attempt to spawn N 
threads for each OpenMP thread (where N is the system-configured 
OpenBLAS thread count). This explosion of threads causes a pretty severe 
performance degradation. In my (pending) package, I currently have a 
compile-time check for POSIX-threaded OpenBLAS which calls 
openblas_set_num_threads before and after OpenMP blocks to stop this 
behavior from occurring. If R were to implement some kind of internal 
FlexiBLAS, this would need to be taken into account.


Best,

This may be not enough. In distributions like Debian, it's possible (if
not common) to install multiple BLAS implementations and switch them
between program runs using update-alternatives, so it's possible to
compile and link a package using one BLAS then run it using another
BLAS.

May I suggest using dlsym() to check whether openblas_get_parallel()
is present in the current process and perform the check during run-time?

(Sorry about not returning to this topic earlier. I do think that a
semaphore is the right choice and I do intend to implement this
interface using semaphores within a few weeks if not a few days.)

Hi everyone,

I have a question. I hope it's not a stupid question.

Suppose you'd want to perform version control and project isolation. You'd create a project folder (let's call it "MyProject"), and place all the R packages you need for that project inside a subfolder (let's say "MyProject/MyLibrary"). Now you create and run an R-script in "MyProject".
install.packages(), library(), etc. all have a lib.loc argument to specify the library path. So one can manually specify the path of your project, and then you'd have your project isolation and version control fully set-up.

But if I want to set-up the library path automatically, to make it portable, I would need to determine the script location. In RStudio I can use the 'rstudioapi' package, which is very stable, and so does not really require version control. But for outside R-Studio, I have not found a very stable package that also works.
I prefer not using external R packages that requires version control (i.e. a package that changes often-ish): you'd need the package to access the project library, but the project library to access the package.

This brings me to my actual question: is it possible to determine the source file location of an R script outside of R-Studio, without resorting to R packages ? Or else use an R package that is VERY stable (i.e. doesn't change every (half) a year, like tidyverse packages tend to do)? commandArgs() used to contain the script path (apparently), but it doesn't work for me.

By the way: I wish to get the script path in an interactive session.

Thank you in advance.

Kind regards,

Tony

Not sure, but I think the 'here' package might do what you want. It's
tidyverse-affiliated but pretty stable

According to the description, this should be what you need:

I only got NULL, but I also only tried within Rstudio...

This depends on how the script is being run. With source(file,
keep.source = TRUE), you can define a function and immediately ask for
the directory from its source reference:

self_dir <- getSrcDirectory(function() {})

With Rscript script.R / R -f script.R / R CMD BATCH script.R, source
references seem to be disabled due to the session not being
interactive, but you can reparse commandArgs(FALSE) and obtain the path
to the script.

It may be more reliable to explicitly launch an R process with the
environment variable R_LIBS set (and maybe also R_PROFILE and
R_ENVIRON) while project work is being done.

See also: https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=ReproducibleResearch for a
list of packages that help with project workflows.

(This may be a better question for R-help, since R packages don't run
as source files; after the package is installed, its compiled form
lives inside the lazy-load database.)

I think 'package:renv' does a lot of the stuff you mentioned here. I
think they accomplished your issue by making an .Rprofile file for
each project. The working directory would be set to the root directory
of the project, the R profile runs and sets .libPaths() as
appropriate, then the scripts can run.

If you don't like that idea, then I don't think you can accomplish
what you want in base R. There are packages that can determine the
path of the current script. I made a package called 'this.path' that
does that, and it works with GUIs RGui for Windows, RStudio, VSCode,
Jupyter, Emacs (indev version, soon to be on CRAN), and from a shell
(Rscript). The core functions of the package are stable, not so much
for others. There are plenty of other packages that offer the same:
'here', 'rprojroot', 'whereami', 'funr', 'scriptName', 'envDocument'.
There may be others. I can't confirm their stability but it would seem
they are stable.

Can't/don't you use relative paths?

library(..., lib.loc = "./MyLibrary")

Then your project is perfectly portable. The only thing you need to take 
care of is to run your code from your project directory. In R-studio 
this is easily done by using projects. Outside of R-studio it depends on 
how and with what you are running your code; in general the programme 
you are using to work with your R-files will know where the R-files are. 
In the terminal, for example, you can cd to your project dir and work 
from there.

Hi,

Appropriate `\dontrun` clauses in the corresponding examples seem to
have made the package pass to the next level of (manual) checks;
fingers crossed that it will go in this time ...

Hi All,

I'm currently attempting to submit a package to CRAN and am getting 
timeouts during the "running examples" phase of the winbuilder tests 
that I cannot reproduce locally or on the r-hub windows runner. How do I 
go about debugging this?

A thirty-year-old format error in the C code of my package eha was 
finally detected by the latest R-devel, thanks to CRAN for that!

However, I also get a message never seen before, when I check the package:

---------------------------------------------------
Attaching package: ?rlang?

The following object is masked from ?package:base?:

     %||%
---------------------------------------------------

I guess that this is a result of my use of devtools and roxygen for 
writing documentation. Is this a bug in rlang and the mask part of the 
message will go away when it is fixed?

Thanks, G?ran

A `%||%` operator has been added to R-devel, and hence
the warning about masking:

Not exactly a bug. It just so happens that rlang exports a function
with the same name as a function already existing in a different
attached package. Same thing happens on a larger scale with other
packages too:

library(dplyr)
# 
# Attaching package: 'dplyr'
# 
# The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
# 
#     filter, lag
# 
# The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
# 
#     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union

As long as the authors of the package that masks functions from another
package are careful to preserve compatibility with the original
function (this typically happens when a package masks a function with
an S3 generic) or you remain aware that the function name is ambiguous,
you will avoid problems.

The `%||%` operators in base and rlang aren't implemented exactly the
same, but they should have the same semantics:

base::`%||%`
# function (x, y)
# if (is.null(x)) y else x
# <bytecode: 0x56054f642d40>
# <environment: namespace:base>
rlang::`%||%`
# function (x, y)
# {
#     if (is_null(x))
#         y
#     else x
# }
# <bytecode: 0x560551c78dc8>
# <environment: namespace:rlang>

Since your eha package doesn't directly use rlang, you're welcome to
ignore this message.

I need to do an rlang release for the same format warning!

I'll take this opportunity to look into conditionally exporting `%||%`
from base, which should solve that warning.

Lionel

Message-ID: <CAJmOi+OWdiZP=y3Rj+LqJcBazH=Fg1W425VYSYhU-ekZLJt2VA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I've been asked to update my package which contains numerous instances of

Rprintf("%lld", xlength(x));

that is, erroneously using %lld for objects of type R_xlen_t.  Having
searched for the correct way, I seem to have come across 3 competing
approaches:

Rprintf("%lld", (long long) xlength(x));
Rprintf("%td, xlength(x));
or
using the string macro found in Mr Kalibera's commit of r85641: R_PRIdXLEN_T

Which would be most advisable for my update, required in the next fortnight?

If you want to future proof your code, the first or third is the way to go.

However, I prefer '%td' for readability. If R ever changes how R_xlen_t is
defined, I assume the checks will alert me to the need to change the format
string.

This is fine. long longs are guaranteed to be at least 64 bits in size
and are signed, just like lengths in R.

> Rprintf("%td, xlength(x));

Maybe if you cast it to ptrdiff_t first. Otherwise I would expect this
to fail on an (increasingly rare) 32-bit system where R_xlen_t is int
(which is an implementation detail).

In my opinion, ptrdiff_t is just the right type for array lengths if
they have to be signed (which is useful for Fortran interoperability),
so Rprintf("%td", (ptrdiff_t)xlength(x)) would be my preferred option
for now. By definition of ptrdiff_t, you can be sure [*] that there
won't be any vectors on your system longer than PTRDIFF_MAX.

I think this will be the best solution once we can afford
having our packages depend on R >= 4.4.

[*] https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/types/ptrdiff_t posits that there
may exist long vectors that fit in SIZE_MAX (unsigned) elements but not
PTRDIFF_MAX (signed) elements. If such vector exists, subtracting two
pointers to its insides may result in undefined behaviour. This may be
already possible in a 32-bit process on Linux running with a 3G
user-space / 1G kernel-space split. The only way around the problem is
to use unsigned types for lengths, but that would preclude Fortran
compatibility.

It worked fine on Linux. Because of this, I resorted to the coercion
strategy, i.e. "%lld" and (long long int)value.  FWIW, on MS Windows,
I see 'ptrsize_t' being 'long long int', whereas on Linux I see 'long
int'.

If I have read the R's change log correctly, C99 printf format is now
supported on Windows. I think the change was made in the last week.

To HB: I also maintain a package that has this problem.  I do not have access to a linux machine (or a machine with the C++ version in question) so I spent quite a while trying to get docker set up. That was a slow process because I had to install R, a bunch of packages, some other software, and so forth.  Anyway, the docker container I had used didn't seem to have a compiler that gave these warnings.  But, by then, I saw that the machine used by

devtools::check_win_devel()

was giving those warnings :-)

So, now there is a way to debug these things.

PS. I also tried using rhub, but it takes a long time and often results in a PREPERROR.

I see 'ptrsize_t' being 'long long int', whereas on Linux I see 'long

This is fine. long longs are guaranteed to be at least 64 bits in size
and are signed, just like lengths in R.

Rprintf("%td, xlength(x));

Maybe if you cast it to ptrdiff_t first. Otherwise I would expect this
to fail on an (increasingly rare) 32-bit system where R_xlen_t is int
(which is an implementation detail).

In my opinion, ptrdiff_t is just the right type for array lengths if
they have to be signed (which is useful for Fortran interoperability),
so Rprintf("%td", (ptrdiff_t)xlength(x)) would be my preferred option
for now. By definition of ptrdiff_t, you can be sure [*] that there
won't be any vectors on your system longer than PTRDIFF_MAX.

using the string macro found in Mr Kalibera's commit of r85641:
R_PRIdXLEN_T

I think this will be the best solution once we can afford
having our packages depend on R >= 4.4.

Daniel, I get those compiler warnings for '%td" MS Windows. It works
fine on Linux.

FYI, https://builder.r-hub.io/ is a great, free service for testing on
various platforms in the cloud.  Also, if you host your package code
on GitHub, it's a small step to configure GitHub Actions to check your
packages across platforms on their servers.  It's free and fairly
straightforward.  There should be plenty of tutorials and examples
online for how to do that with R packages.  So, no need to mock around
with Linux containers etc.

I hope it's okay to ask this on the present thread, rather than starting a new one...

On this issue of the C format for various integer-type items, I am finding that checks made with devtools::check_win_devel() give different results than those made with the github R-CMD-check action named ubuntu-latest-devel.  Which (if either) might be best for someone trying to fix up code for a CRAN release?

# Details

The code

NumericVector a;
::R_error("size %ld", a.size());

does not lead to warnings with R-CMD-check/ubuntu-latest-devel compilation, but it does with devtools::check_win_devel().  And the reverse is true with the code

NumericVector a;
::R_error("size %lld", a.size());

so one of these two methods must not be a good way to know if I'm doing the right thing.  I don't want to submit an update to CRAN that will lead to problems there, so I am keen to find a way to test this aspect without making a new submission (and thereby wasting time for the kind folks who run CRAN).

Thanks.

Dan.

Please let me clarify. %td works in R on Windows in R 4.3 and R-devel, 
when using the recommended toolchain, which is Rtools43. It also worked 
with R 4.2 and Rtools42. It works since R has switched to UCRT on 
Windows. I assume you are not using a recommended toolchain and this is 
why you are getting the warning - please let me know if this is not the 
case and I will try to help.

There is a bug in GCC, still present in gcc 12 and gcc 10, due to which 
gcc displays warnings about the format even when it is supported. The 
details are complicated, but in short, it accidentally applies both 
Microsoft format and C99/GNU format checks to printf functions with UCRT 
- so you get a warning whenever the two formats disagree, which includes 
printing a 64 bit integer.? Also for %td which is not supported by 
Microsoft format. Or say %zu (size_t) or %Lf (long double). I've been 
patching GCC in Rtools42 and Rtools43 to avoid this problem, so you 
don't get the warning there. My patch has been picked up also by Msys2, 
I didn't check whether it is still there or not. Finally a new 
implementation of the patch was accepted to GCC trunk, so eventually 
this will no longer be needed. But regardless which version of GCC 
Rtools44 will use, I will make sure it will accept C99 printf formats 
without warnings. An unpatched GCC 10 or 12 with UCRT will print a 
warning for %td but will support it.

Right, this has been my choice for R-devel, at least for now. It still 
has downsides. In principle, it is not guaranteed that ptrdiff_t won't 
become bigger than long long at some point (but it is extremely unlikely 
anyone would run into that in R ever with array indexes). Then, on the 
other hand, it may be a waste in some cases, ptrdiff_t is smaller and in 
theory the generated code may be faster in some cases (that of course 
wouldn't matter for errors or I/O, but maybe in theory it could with 
purely string operations).

Yes, that is fine, too, with the cast, as long as R_xlen_t is not bigger 
than ptrdiff_t. You would have a problem if it ever changed in R. I 
don't think it is likely, but, technically, the formal guarantees in the 
C standard about for which array indexing ptrdiff_t are somewhat weak, 
maybe we might need to change this to support bigger arrays or maybe use 
the type R_xlen_t also for something slightly different that needs to be 
bigger.

Yes, the goal was to allow most C99 way using this macro, so e.g.

Rprintf("my index %" R_PRIdXLEN_T "\n", xlength(x));

(note the space before and after the macro in concatenation to be C++ 
friendly). This doesn't have the limitations described before, but, 
there is a problem with translations. I am still looking into that, but 
from what I can tell, gettext doesn't make this possible. A good support 
would allow strings described this way and also translated this way, 
using the symbolic name of the macro, not the expansion.

But, unless you use gettext/translations, this last option is probably 
best. Yet you would have to define the macro if not defined to support R 
4.3 and older versions.

I don't want to submit an update to CRAN that will lead to problems there, so I am keen to find a way to test this aspect without making a new submission (and thereby wasting time for the kind folks who run CRAN).

I think the best way to deal with these is to look at the lines and 
arguments identified by any of the compilers on any of the test 
platforms you have, and then based on reading the code and learning what 
the types really are (or are guaranteed to be) decide on how to fix. The 
presence and wording of the warnings may be compiler specific. In some 
cases even platform specific, because some C types have different size 
on different platforms, or map to different underlying types.

So, if the line above was identified by the compiler, check the 
documentation for NumericVector::size(), which type does it guarantee to 
return. The compiler warning may give a hint (what the type is in your 
build), but indeed it wouldn't consult the documentation. If the type is 
R_xlen_t (I didn't check if it is), then you could do e.g.

::R_error("size %lld", (long long)a.size());

or better

::R_error("size %" R_PRIdXLEN_T ", a.size());

as discussed elsewhere in this thread.

It is not a good idea to just use the type given in the warning, because 
that may not be portable. In this case, your compiler warning (on Linux) 
may have said "long int", which may have been how "ptrdiff_t" is defined 
on the platform by the compiler, which is probably how R_xlen_t is 
defined on your platform. But, it may be different elsewhere. On your 
second platform, the compiler warning may have said "long long int" (on 
Windows), which may have been how "ptrdiff_t" is defined there by the 
compiler, and on that platform, "long int" is different from "long long 
int", so the former didn't work.

If you use the Winbuilder service maintained by Uwe Ligges, you will 
have the same setup as one of the platforms used for CRAN incoming checks.

I forgot to say that one needs R-devel 85640 or newer. You could get the 
warning for %td etc also with R-devel between 85639 and R-devel 85619, 
even with the recommended toolchain, because these versions used 
"printf" format in the header, but on Windows it needs to use 
"gnu_printf" (which is the C99/UCRT format). I've fixed that in 85640.

Dear all,


I have two packages on CRAN (ast2ast and paropt). Notably, paropt 
depends on ast2ast. Currently, I'm working on a major update of ast2ast 
which changes the API at specific points that are used by paropt. Thus, 
the update will break paropt.

I am reaching out to seek your suggestions on how Ican smoothly navigate 
this transition with minimal disruption.

Thanks a lot in advance.

Best Konrad

If you cannot prepare paropt in a way that it works with both versions 
of ast2ast, you can at least prepare a new version that work with the 
new ast2ast and explain upon submission of axt2axt that paropt is well 
prepared for submissions once ast2ast got released.

Thank you.

I was getting those compiler warnings on %td when using the widely
used https://github.com/r-lib/actions tool chain.  It was using
gcc.exe (GCC) 12.2.0 two-three days ago.  I reran it yesterday, and it
seems to have been fixed now.  It is now reporting on gcc.exe (GCC)
12.3.0.  Not sure if that was the fix, or there was something else.

Interesting. Thanks for this work and pushing this upstreams.

It sounds like '%td' is supported, and it's just that there's a false
warning. Do you happen to know we can assume '%td' is compatible with
much older versions of GCC too? My question is basically, can I safely
use '%td' with older version of GCC, e.g. for older versions of R, and
assume it'll compile on MS Windows?  In my case, we're trying to keep
'matrixStats' backward quite far back, and I can imagine there are
other packages doing that too.

Thanks,

Henrik

Thanks. I don't know what that service uses, it is not maintained by R Core.

No, %td would not work with R < 4.2 built using the then recommended 
toolchains, because MSVCRT was used, which did not support %td. The 
runtime library would not be able to print such value.

For such old versions of R, you would have to do something else. I think 
PRId64 from inttypes.h and a cast to "(long long)" should work. The 
macro would expand to the Microsoft format pattern in the older 
versions. Or depending on what you want to do, also you could simply 
cast to double and print that way.

CRAN only tests and builds R-devel, R-release and R-oldrelease (4.2 at 
this point).

Do I understand it correctly that in multiple win-builder tests, you
always get a timeout in the same inmf example? Or is it different
examples?

There doesn't seem to be a lot of code between Rcpp::Rcerr << "INMF
started, niter=" << niter << std::endl; and Progress p(niter, verbose);
to crash or hang in. I've tried to reproduce the problem myself, but it
doesn't happen to me either.

So far I only noticed minor things, like the build-time dependency on
pkgbuild (from tools/WindowsOverrides/hdf5/hdf5-config.cmake) that may
be worth declaring in your DESCRIPTION. I also think that your patch to
hwloc can be reduced by adding a -DNDEBUG somewhere instead of patching
out calls to assert(). I think that the C standard (e.g. C99, WG14 draft
version N1256, 7.4) requires assert() to expand to ((void)0) if NDEBUG
is defined.

The amount of systems engineering effort to do the right thing that
went into this package is really impressive; I'd hate to see it fail.

Hi Ivan,

Thank you for giving my package check a run-through. You have it 
correct-every win-builder log hangs/halts in that exact example. The 
only other anomaly I notice on win-builder is that the elapsed time 
reported to Rcout is 0-which is clearly incorrect. DNDEBUG removing the 
assert calls would certainly make my life quite a bit easier when it 
comes time to maintain the package, so I'll definitely give that a try. 
Re: declared requirements, WindowsOverrides contains slightly modified 
copies of cmake locator files with patches that will likely be included 
in a later Rtools43 release. I'm fairly sure pkgbuild in rtools can be 
assumed present, but that's more of a Tomas question (and it may be 
worth declaring either way). Regardless, those files aren't intended to 
stick around for any longer than they need to. Any other suggestions are 
always welcome, but I do get the feeling that something is fishy on 
win-builder's end.


Best,

Andrew

I added a badge to point to Conda builds for the work repo:

  [![Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/r-tiledb/badges/version.svg)](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/r-tiledb)


And as it goes with all good intentions I immediately got punished on the
next upload:

  Found the following (possibly) invalid URLs:
    URL: https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/r-tiledb
      From: README.md
      Status: 400
      Message: Bad Request

And *of course* the same URL resolves fine for me in the browser without any
apparent redirect.  Bit of a web newb here but is there anything I can do
short of deleteing the badge?

The badge you're referencing is hosted by a cloudflare CDN, which uses
"magic" to return error responses to non-humans.

You can see this behavior by running curl against the URL:

curl -I https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/r-tiledb
HTTP/2 400
server: cloudflare
...

I have seen this behavior for other resources, but generally have
experienced 403 responses.

This urlchecker issue discusses what I had seen:
https://github.com/r-lib/urlchecker/issues/26

I do not have guidance other than to either remove the URL or add a note
stating that the 400 errors are only presented to robots. Perhaps CRAN
occasionally adjusts its User-Agent to avoid some of these challenges? Not
sure.

This (status 400) underlies manual inspection and we let this pass.

The problem is that https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/PACKAGE fails to
answer to HEAD requests and only answers to GET requests. HEAD differs
from GET in that there is no need to send the actual content of the page
in response to the request; it is enough to say "200 OK" (and pass the
check) or, as it happens here, "400 Bad Request".

It may help to ask ContinuumIO to support HEAD requests by filing a bug
report for the Anaconda.org website at
<https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/>. It may be worth
referencing RFC 9110, section 9.3.2
<https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#name-head>, in
particular:

>> The HEAD method is identical to GET except that the server MUST NOT
>> send content in the response.

>> The server SHOULD send the same header fields in response to a HEAD
>> request as it would have sent if the request method had been GET.

Arguably, the spirit of the standard is being violated here (if not the
letter, which only mentions headers).

Thank you all -- expecially Aron and Ivan for the deep dive on the underlying
aspect of the hosting of that web property.  And of course to Uwe for
approving the package manually.

For my taste, life is too short for all this. So users be damned, and I have
now removed the badge.  At the end of the day it is better for Uwe et al (and
of course our side) to have these things autoprocess. If this kind of stuff
is in the way, I will just remove it as maintainer.

Thanks again to all.

Cheers, Dirk

Hi,

I maintain the prqlr package that uses rustc for compiling, so I 
regularly check the version of Rust on CRAN.
And I have noticed that the Rust version of Fedora has been stagnant for 
the past few months and was wondering why, but upon investigation I 
realized that this is because Fedora on CRAN is currently Fedora 36 (out 
of support in May).
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_flavors.html>

It was quite a surprise to me that out of support Fedora is being used, 
but what is the normal cycle for machines on CRAN to be updated? And do 
we have any way of knowing that schedule?

Best,
Tatsuya

It depends on the maintainer who cares about these machine, the 
institution where it is hosted, the availability of technical staff, and 
the technical pressure.

I could not even say when the machines I maintain will be updated.
On one version of the retired winbuilder severs we kept the same OS 
version for almost 10 years.

Uwe Ligges

Hi All,

I want to share that we have developed a template R package that easily incorporates C++ code via Rcpp. This template streamlines the process of integrating R and C++. The template package facilitates:

Flexibility in  Building: It employs the CMake build system, offering more versatility than the standard R build system. This makes incorporating external libraries a breeze.
Efficient Testing Environment: Comes equipped with the Catch2 library, setting up a streamlined pipeline for testing and development.
Ease of Development: Designed for simplicity, it requires minimal Rcpp experience, allowing for a faster and more accessible development process.
Versatility for C++ Projects: The package can also be integrated as a separate module in any C++ project.


More details can be found: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7136774813066358785/

The template: https://github.com/stsds/Template-Rcpp

Your feedback and contribution is so important to us.


Best,
--Sameh

Dear R package developers,

Package TPmsm is not passing the incoming checks.
The following messages appear on 00check.log:

The example was running with 2 threads initially. Now it is running with 1 thread.
However, this example is not multithreaded, so there should be no difference.
Actually, for this example, the number of threads does not make any difference under my system.
I have no idea what is going on! Unfortunately, I do not have Linux to test.
Is there anyone who can help?

The package source code is here -> https://github.com/arturstat/TPmsm
The example in question can be found here -> https://github.com/arturstat/TPmsm/blob/main/man/contour.TPCmsm.Rd

Message-ID: <486DB786-9BB2-4FFE-998F-E6BD024D5D0B@oist.jp>

ello,

I have added some functions to read binary files in my asteRisk package. The binary files that are read contain just arrays of coefficients and metadata about these.

I would like to provide a small file of these to be used in the examples of the man page for the functions that read them. However, section 1.1 of "Writing R Extensions? states that no binary files are accepted in submissions to CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html)

I was wondering if it would be acceptable to download the example file to a temporary file in the example themselves (and in fact, also in unit tests), and then read it from there?

I could not find any statement against this in ?Writing R Extensions?, but I would like to confirm that this is OK to do before submitting an updated version of the package to CRAN.

Thanks a lot in advance

Best wishes,

Rafa

In these cases, I unfortunately find the best approach to be to wrap the
examples in `if (interactive()) ` to ensure that they will not be ran on
CRAN tests machines. It hampers the checks of CRAN but it makes it possible
to get usable code to users.

Rafael,

I believe the issue is that packages cannot include binary *executables.* If
you have a binary file (such as a parquet file) in inst/extdata, I do not
think that would be a problem. It would be a good idea to ensure that that
file is small, though. I think downloading a file is a big no no to be ran
on CRAN machines. I would personally advise against downloading anything.

Files can be "binary" in multiple different senses. Your files are
binary in the sense that they contain data not in a plain text format.
This usage is fine. PNG images and files produced by save() or
saveRDS() are binary in this sense too.

Files can also be "binary" in the sense that they are not
human-readable source code for a computer program, but compiled
executable code. *.exe's and *.dll's, *.so's and *.dylib's, and also
*.jar files are binaries in this sense. The reason they are forbidden
is because they are much harder to inspect than the source code they
have been compiled from.

It's not always so clear-cut, though. One example is R's own
serialization format where one could save a function and later restore
and run it. If R did not allow this, it would be much less convenient
to use, despite being slightly more secure. In another example, due to
a vulnerability, a binary data file (or even a text file, say, a
JavaScript program) may contain an encoded computer program that the
data-reading program will execute instead of reading it due to being
confused. (E.g. jailbreak.me used to confuse iPhones into overwriting
parts of their firmware despite that's normally not allowed for a
website.)

It is important to write parsers for binary and text files so that even
if these files are produced by an adversary, the program reading them
will not be tricked into executing program code stored inside. You
should be mostly safe if you're doing this in pure R (or else R may
need to be fixed).

Same from here:
meant are files containing executable code such as shared or statically 
linked libraries, executables etc.
Binary data files are permitted.

CRAN knows about Bioconductor packages, so add phyloseq to Depends: , Imports:, or Suggests: as appropriate.

These CRAN packages seem to Import phyloseq, for instance

Can you tell us which package you are talking about? Otherwise we cannot 
say why you see the error.

Thanks for your answer.

Unlike Windows Server, which has a long support period, Fedora's support 
period is usually about one year, so it is surprising that the old 
Fedora continues to be used.
And, unlike Windows, Linux uses the distribution standard packages for 
builds, which causes problems like the current Fedora machine that 
continues to use the old Rust.

Hope to see an update soon. Thanks to the staff for maintaining the 
infrastructure.

Best,
Tatsuya

The configuration currently at different CRAN machines is just a sample 
of what your users might have, just an example of a setting packages 
should be able to deal with. Some users might also still have FC36, some 
might have another Linux distribution (possibly still supported), which 
has older software than that.

I wouldn't recommend spending time tracking which version of which 
software CRAN systems currently happen to have, but rather making sure 
packages can deal with different versions (possibly with some in a 
restricted way, possibly making some hard requirements when necessary).

Unfortunately, it is often important for us to pay attention to what
machines our code is being tested on.

I think the point is more or less that we often find ourselves trying to
make super small adjustments for machines and builds that are used by a
number of users in the single digits. The vast majority of R programmers
are not on these arcane machines. We should strive to support the vast
majority of users who use *fairly* standard distributions such as Mac,
Windows, Ubuntu, Debian, and maybe even Centos. Getting a note for a
release which has reach EOL can be confusing and tough to know how to
handle.

I do think that its a reasonable ask that the test machines be running operating systems within their vendor support periods.

Unfortunately, it is often important for us to pay attention to what
machines our code is being tested on.

I think the point is more or less that we often find ourselves trying to
make super small adjustments for machines and builds that are used by a
number of users in the single digits. The vast majority of R programmers
are not on these arcane machines. We should strive to support the vast
majority of users who use *fairly* standard distributions such as Mac,
Windows, Ubuntu, Debian, and maybe even Centos. Getting a note for a
release which has reach EOL can be confusing and tough to know how to
handle.

Thanks for your offer to providing us with capable multicore servers and 
support staff for continuing support of recent Fedora systems.

Dear Artur,

You've got a well-written package. There are some parts I wasn't able
to understand (e.g. changing the class of a variable by reference using
SET_CLASS and later changing it back), but there are no obvious places
where a mistake could be hiding.

I managed to reproduce this, but not before compiling R-devel r85646
on a Debian Testing virtual machine using clang-17 and flang-17 with
libomp-17-dev installed. In particular, this doesn't seem to happen
with latest R-devel built using (much older versions of) the GNU
toolchain.

There was a false start where I saw pthread_create breakpoints hit
inside libpango while contour() was running, but that couldn't be your
problem because examples run with the pdf() device active. Instead,
when source()ing the TPmsm-Ex.R file, the breakpoint fired elsewhere:

### Name: as.data.frame.survTP
### Title: as.data.frame method for a survTP object
### Aliases: as.data.frame.survTP
### Keywords: manip metho .... [TRUNCATED]

83              #pragma omp parallel num_threads(global_num_threads)
(gdb) p global_num_threads
$4 = 8

Not sure why the CPU time gets counted for the contour() example
instead of as.data.frame.survTP - do libomp threads not get counted
until they terminate or something? - but since the contour.TPCmsm
example directly follows as.data.frame.survTP, the call to dgpTP here
must be the culprit.

I would like to suggest a new diagnostic for the CPU time / elapsed
time tests. If any examples have been found to exceed the time ratio
limit and R is running on Linux with a special environment variable
set, the examples should be re-run under a debugger. The debugger
should set a breakpoint on the clone _system call_ (ideally, all system
calls that can create threads or child processes) and print a C-level
backtrace when it fires. Ideally, it should call something like
R_ConciseTraceback to obtain an R-level traceback too, but it's not an
API (at least yet) and I'm not sure it's generally safe to do this in
the middle of an R call. If there is interest, I can try to see if gdb
can be scripted to make this happen. I think it must be a ptrace
debugger and not an LD_PRELOAD wrapper because there are too many ways
to start threads and processes. For example, with libomp,
pthread_create() breakpoints fire while clone() breakpoints do not,
despite something later does make the clone() system call.

This won't help if the threads get started separately and only later
get utilised in a different example, but I wasn't able to put the
output of `perf report` for good use when debugging similar problems in
a different package. Other ideas for tracing the CPU usage culprits are
also welcome.

Ivan

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] macos x86 oldrel backups?
Message-ID: <CAE+qdJaYzFK1fCEuscvXE4hJA=4APUiE=XpLS4BMOj5K08LNHQ@mail.gmail.com>

Thank you to the CRAN maintainers for maintenance and keeping the all
of the CRAN infrastructure running.

I'm seeing a long delay in builds on CRAN for r-oldrel-macos-x86_64.
I'm currently interested in Arrow [1], but I'm seeing many other
packages with similar missing r-oldrel-macos-x86_64 builds (possibly
all, I sampled a few packages from [2], but didn't do an exhaustive
search) for an extended period.

It appears that this started between 2023-10-21 and 2023-10-22. It
looks like AMR [3] has a successful build but xlcutter does not [4]
and all the packages I've checked after 2023-10-22 don't have an
updated build for r-oldrel-macos-x86_64

Sorry if this is scheduled maintenance, I tried to find an
announcement here and on r-project.org but haven't yet found anything
indicating this.

Jon,

The high-sierra build packages are currently not built due to hardware issues. The macOS version is so long out of support by Apple (over 6 years) that it is hard to maintain it. Only big-sur builds are supported at this point. Although it is possible that we may be able to restore the old builds, it is not guaranteed. (BTW the right mailing list for this is R-SIG-Mac).

Cheers,
Simon

Hi Simon,

Interesting.  And I see at mac.r-project.org the statement

   [...] As of R 4.3.0 we maintain two binary builds:

   - big-sur-x86_64 build supports legacy Intel Macs from macOS 11 (Big Sur) and higher
   - big-sur-arm64 build supports arm64 Macs (M1+) from macOS 11 (Big Sur) and higher

   We are no longer building binaries for macOS versions before 11 (as they
   are no longer supported by Apple).

so it is official that r-oldrel on macOS is no more for now? So we do not
have to worry about compilation standards lower than 11.0?  Do I have that
correct? 

Dirk
not on r-sig-mac, appreciative of any hints here as that is what we created the list for

I can't help with providing servers, but if the primary issue with 
builder software maintenance is manpower I would be more than willing to 
contribute and I imagine others would be as well. Perhaps logistically 
challenging, but more than doable.

I spent this afternoon trying to figure out what exactly was going on 
here. In my several submissions to winbuilder (sorry Uwe) I have 
confirmed that the culprit is /not/:

  * writing to Rcpp::rcout
  * openmp
  * std::chrono::high_resolution_clock

Every time, it reports a runtime of zero seconds for INMF res1 and 
hangs/is killed on initiation of INMF res2 before the initialization of 
RcppProgress. I'm at a bit of a loss here.


Best,

-Andrew

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] How to create a macos-arm64 virtual machine/cloud
 environment to debug R package?
Message-ID: <CALnEB15LXzBzdV=P+eM_=efORoztOO8Po83qR+grRoqdwqGadQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

What is the recommended way to create a virtual machine or cloud based R
environment for debugging R package issues specific to OS macos-arm64?

Details:
CRAN results show macos-arm64 specific problems for my package:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_GGIR.html. I am able to
reproduce them with https://mac.r-project.org/macbuilder/submit.html. I
suspect something goes wrong with the timestamp creation or handling as
that has caused issues with this OS for me in the past. All this relates to
this
<https://github.com/wadpac/GGIR/blob/master/tests/testthat/test_part5_analyseRest.R>
test for this
<https://github.com/wadpac/GGIR/blob/master/R/g.part5.analyseRest.R>
function, that in the process calls this
<https://github.com/wadpac/GGIR/blob/master/R/POSIXtime2iso8601.R> short
function. I have been trying some edits locally and re-submitting them to
macbuilder a couple of times to no avail. To debug this efficiently it
would be good to have access to an R environment for this OS. I do not have
a physical macos myself.

Vincent

Sorry, I now see that this may actually be a timezone specific issue which
I can now reproduce in Windows by changing the timezone of the timeseries
to "Pacific/Auckland".

This would indicate that macos-arm64 CRAN machines are based in a different
timezone than the other machines, not the arm64 OS as such.

This reminds me that I ran into a similar issues earlier this year where I
struggled to get GitHub Actions to run the macos workflow in a non-default
timezone, which I raised elsewhere:
https://community.rstudio.com/t/upgrading-github-action-workflow-to-address-no-package-called-rcmdcheck-but-unclear-how-to-account-for-timezone/166876
... I should have thought about that first.

This is just a punt from a quick glance at your tests. Try using the following on your local build to ensure it's not a time zone issue

`TZ=NZ R CMD check --as-cran`

`Apologies if this is just noise but whenever I've had issues with datetimes and mac tests this is the first thing I check.`

I get exactly 0 seconds for both res1 and res2 on both my Windows
machines and on my Linux machine. I had discounted that as an integer
type used somewhere for elapsed time. Is that (exactly 0 seconds and an
objective value of 44244.4) supposed to indicate a problem?

Can we eliminate it running out of time? On my Windows 10 LTSC machine
(AMD Ryzen 5 2400G from 2018, SATA SSD, nothing else going on at the
time) the complete R CMD check takes slightly more than 10.5 minutes.
An R-release check running on an Intel Xeon E5-2680 from 2016 with
other checks going on at the same time could plausibly take more than 20
minutes and get terminated [1], with some of the buffered output
never reaching the RcppPlanc-Ex.Rout file... but then it happens on a
much faster R-devel checking machine [2], which runs on an AMD EPYC
7443, and we never see any differences in the output. Right?

Hi again,

I just double checked the test invocations of INMF which are on /much/ 
larger matrices with /far/ more iterations and am still seeing zero 
seconds. That /is/ a bug, but its not a related one. The objective error 
of 44244.4 is what it should be returning for the example matrices.


I just benchmarked devtools::check() (which is actually a build followed 
by a check) on my Ryzen 5700X/intel 660p system with a bunch of stuff 
going on in the background and got just over 11 minutes. I don't 
actually think its timing out. No output differences, of course.


If you could get me more information (perhaps off-list) about the 
-lstdc++ thing I'm curious about reproducing that.

Best.

-Andrew Robbins

Dear Ivan,

I modified the example in:
https://github.com/arturstat/TPmsm/blob/main/man/as.data.frame.survTP.Rd
And it finally passed CRAN incoming checks:
https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/TPmsm_1.2.12_20231207_221140/Debian/00check.log
Thank you.

Dear Artur,

You've got a well-written package. There are some parts I wasn't able
to understand (e.g. changing the class of a variable by reference using
SET_CLASS and later changing it back), but there are no obvious places
where a mistake could be hiding.

I managed to reproduce this, but not before compiling R-devel r85646
on a Debian Testing virtual machine using clang-17 and flang-17 with
libomp-17-dev installed. In particular, this doesn't seem to happen
with latest R-devel built using (much older versions of) the GNU
toolchain.

There was a false start where I saw pthread_create breakpoints hit
inside libpango while contour() was running, but that couldn't be your
problem because examples run with the pdf() device active. Instead,
when source()ing the TPmsm-Ex.R file, the breakpoint fired elsewhere:

Not sure why the CPU time gets counted for the contour() example
instead of as.data.frame.survTP - do libomp threads not get counted
until they terminate or something? - but since the contour.TPCmsm
example directly follows as.data.frame.survTP, the call to dgpTP here
must be the culprit.

I would like to suggest a new diagnostic for the CPU time / elapsed
time tests. If any examples have been found to exceed the time ratio
limit and R is running on Linux with a special environment variable
set, the examples should be re-run under a debugger. The debugger
should set a breakpoint on the clone _system call_ (ideally, all system
calls that can create threads or child processes) and print a C-level
backtrace when it fires. Ideally, it should call something like
R_ConciseTraceback to obtain an R-level traceback too, but it's not an
API (at least yet) and I'm not sure it's generally safe to do this in
the middle of an R call. If there is interest, I can try to see if gdb
can be scripted to make this happen. I think it must be a ptrace
debugger and not an LD_PRELOAD wrapper because there are too many ways
to start threads and processes. For example, with libomp,
pthread_create() breakpoints fire while clone() breakpoints do not,
despite something later does make the clone() system call.

This won't help if the threads get started separately and only later
get utilised in a different example, but I wasn't able to put the
output of `perf report` for good use when debugging similar problems in
a different package. Other ideas for tracing the CPU usage culprits are
also welcome.

Hello,

I'm the maintener of the rtkore package and I'm experimenting an error during the installation on 
the |r-devel-windows-x86_64| and the |r-release-windows-x86_64| platform. When trying to compile I get

A search indicate that the problem is from the "D:" (not sure it is the correct answer)

In all case, I cannot modify these path as there given by the CRAN mechanism of compilation.

Can you give me some hints about the problem and how to solve it ?

Then it's probably not a timeout, thanks for confirming this. If you've
eliminated Rcpp::Rcout, OpenMP and std::chrono::high_resolution_clock,
the crash must be happening inside
planc::INMF<T>::computeObjectiveError for T = arma::mat but not T =
arma::sp_mat.

I see that inmf() is one of the first examples that tests the fitting
functions (and exercises Armadillo), but not the first such example.
Inside RcppPlanc-Ex.R, there is bppnnls() which should have exercised
both arma::mat and arma::sp_mat cases, but with a different algorithm.

My yet another unlikely idea is that something is going wrong when
linking the package with OpenBLAS while another BLAS (provided by R) is
present in the address space. Not a lot of CRAN packages do this, and
some of those that did are now archived:
<https://github.com/search?q=org%3Acran+openblas&type=code>

Evidently it works on Linux and on our Windows machines, but maybe the
Win-Builder configuration uncovers something that we don't see
ourselves. I think we need the help of Uwe Ligges to see a backtrace,
otherwise I don't know what to change.

(I wonder if it's possible to enhance the current Win-Builder setup
with something like https://github.com/jrfonseca/drmingw to catch the
process crashing and print the annotated traceback somewhere for the
Win-Builder scripts to pick it up. The tricky part will be to only
handle `R CMD check` launched by the scripts but not anything else.)

Dear Olga Viedma,

Welcome to R-package-devel!

When looking for advice here, it's best to link to the package code and
the R CMD check report you have received.

The maintainer address is always printed here, with a
Note_for_CRAN_maintainers instead of NOTE if all other tests pass
successfully. Unfortunately, this is not the whole NOTE:
https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/LadderFuelsR_0.0.1_20231207_204411/Debian/00check.log

>> New submission

This NOTE is expected to happen. New submissions require manual review.

>> Possibly misspelled words in DESCRIPTION:
>>  LiDAR (3:67, 9:94)

I think you can mention this being an established term of the art in
the comment field. Only new submissions are spell-checked, so once the
package is accepted, this won't reappear either. Alternatively, you can
serialize a character vector of words into an .rds file under .aspell
(see help(aspell)) so that it will be accepted by the automated check:

saveRDS(c('LiDAR'), '.aspell/dictionary.rds')

(This is untested but follows the documentation and the R CMD check
source code.)

>> Found the following (possibly) invalid URLs:

This automated check makes sure that any URL listed in the
documentation (README or help pages) directly points to a web page.
It's not exactly obvious unless you run R CMD check --as-cran yourself,
but https://travis-ci.com/olgaviedma/LadderFuelsR redirects to
https://www.travis-ci.com/olgaviedma/LadderFuelsR. If you add the
missing www., you will get rid of the problem.

Well, the missing d: or /d/ in the last line of your cited output.
Which package is this? Then I could take a look into the sources.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Status of -mmacosx-version-min
Message-ID: <25972.55074.531674.648876@rob.eddelbuettel.com>


Last month, I had asked about the setting '-mmacosx-version-min' here.  The
setting can be used to specify what macOS version one builds for. It is,
oddly enough, not mentioned in Writing R Extension but for both r-release and
r-devel the R Administration manual states

   ? Current CRAN macOS distributions are targeted at Big Sur so it is
     wise to ensure that the compilers generate code that will run on
     Big Sur or later.  With the recommended compilers we can use
          CC="clang -mmacosx-version-min=11.0"
          CXX="clang++ -mmacosx-version-min=11.0"
          FC="/opt//gfortran/bin/gfortran -mmacosx-version-min=11.0"
     or set the environment variable
          export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=11.0

which is clear enough. (There is also an example in the R Internals manual
still showing the old (and deprecated ?) value of 10.13.)  It is also stated
at the top of mac.r-project.org.  But it is still in a somewhat confusing
contradiction to the matrix of tests machines, described e.g. at

   https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_flavors.html

which still has r-oldrel-macos-x86_64 with 10.13.

I found this confusing, and pressed the CRAN macOS maintainer to clarify but
apparently did so in an insuffciently convincing manner. (There was a word
about it being emailed to r-sig-mac which is a list I am not on as I don't
have a macOS machine.) So in case anybody else wonders, my hope is that the
above is of help. At my day job, we will now switch to 11.0 to take advantage
of some more recent C++ features.

Message-ID: <07E99E31-4739-4BBE-BBF0-0144D6540F61@R-project.org>

As discussed here before packages should *never* set -mmacosx-version-min or similar flags by hand. As documented in R-exts 1.2 packages should retrieve compiler flags from R (this includes compiling 3rd party dependencies). Incidentally, older versions of R have included -mmacosx-version-min in the CC setting (high-sierra builds) which current ones don't, but complying packages will automatically use the correct compilers and flags regardless of the R version and build. Note that this is important as R can be built for different systems and targets so the package should not assume anything - just ask R.

The implied question was about the target macOS version for CRAN binaries: it is always included in the build name, so high-sierra build was targeting macOS 10.13 (High Sierra) and big-sur build is targeting macOS 11 (Big Sur). It is clearly stated next to the download for each macOS R binary on CRAN: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/ where the current releases target macOS 11.

Anyone distributing macOS binaries should subscribe to R-SIG-Mac where we discuss details such as repository locations etc. Developers writing packages just need to pay attention to R-exts and CRAN policies (the latter if they want to publish on CRAN). I hope this is now clear enough explanation.

Cheers,
Simon

b) That is in conflict with how I read the R manual I quoted: R Admin,

binary artifact (by permission) so we have to play along and this minimum
version used by both matters.

c) That also appears to be in conflict with empirics. A quick search [1] at
the searchable CRAN mirror finds around a dozen packages doing just that:
setting a minimum version.

Anyway -- I 'eventually' got the info I need.

PS One aspect I didn't mention clearly (my bad) that this does not affect all
or even most packages: in most cases the src/Makevars should indeed be as
simple as possible. But in _some_ cases we need to cooperate with external
libraries and in some of these cases the switch has been seen to be necessary.

 Fedora clang/llvm
Message-ID: <CAHDtqqmBmRNNuPQ4-+c3dPBs+59AiyMKkh7sZshYrevbtx4wiA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Everyone,

I'm a co-lead on the development of the {rsofun} package, a package to
model ecosystem processes.

https://github.com/geco-bern/rsofun

The package uses a FORTRAN code base which is giving us some compilation
and CRAN compliance problems. Our last submission was withdrawn with the
following errors on Fedora: "
error:
loc("/data/gannet/ripley/R/packages/incoming/rsofun.Rcheck/00_pkg_src/rsofun/src/interface_biosphere_biomee.mod.f90":105:62):
/data/gannet/ripley/Sources2/LLVM/17.0/llvm-project-17.0.3.src/flang/lib/Lower/ConvertType.cpp:392:
not yet implemented: derived type components with non default lower bounds
"

This seems to be resolved when setting the suggested compiler flags for
Fedora as: `-fc-prototypes-external`. However, this generates Warnings
throughout platforms, as setting these compiler flags in Makevars is
considered poor practice.

I'm wondering how to reconcile both demands, i.e. addressing the above
CLANG/LLVM issue, while not setting the compiler flags? Any guidance or
ideas on this would be appreciated.

Kind regards,
Koen

Experience shows that reporting bugs in flang-new may get them
acknowledged but not fixed [1]. Have you tried detecting the flang-new
compiler from the ./configure script and only adding the workaround
flag if the compiler matches? Something like the following:

#!/bin/sh
# taken from Writing R Extensions, 1.2. Configure and cleanup
: ${R_HOME=`R RHOME`}
if test -z "${R_HOME}"; then
  echo "could not determine R_HOME"
  exit 1
fi
# determine the Fortran 9x compiler
FC="`"${R_HOME}/bin/R" CMD config FC`"
# Use --version output to determine the compiler
# A different compiler will either accept --version and print something
# else or fail due to "unknown argument". In both cases the branch will
# not be taken
if "$FC" --version 2>/dev/null | grep -q 'flang-new version 17'; then
 echo "PKG_FCFLAGS = `"${R_HOME}/bin/R" CMD config FCFLAGS`" \
  " -fc-prototypes-external" >>src/Makevars
fi

You will still get an "unsupported flag" warning on machines with
flang-new, but at least it won't warn with standards-compliant
compilers or crash with flang-new. Unfortunately, I don't know whether
this is acceptable for CRAN, sorry.

Good luck!

Just to understand your expectations: The 'run examples' option only works
within the "dynamic" R help system, because it has access to a running
version of R. Vignettes can also be viewed through the dynamic system, but
they perhaps more useful as standalone documentation (say on the CRAN page
of a package). Would it be really useful to be able to run the code only in
the limited setup of dynamic help?

The other issue is that examples are expected to be short and simple,
whereas vignettes can often be more complicated. They will also typically
include the "output" from running the code, so what would be the point of
running it again?

If you want to really try the vignette code, then the package documentation
page typically includes the R code extracted from a vignette, which you can
download and run. And of course with IDEs like ESS or RStudio, you can
simply open the vignette source and run the code interactively.

Best,
-Deepayan

Technically, yes, but very hard to implement in practice.

Vignettes are a form of literate programming, expressed in terms of
files: there's a source file containing code mixed with prose, and
there are two programs, one of which extracts the code into a runnable
.R file and the other renders the code together with prose and any
resulting plots into a human-readable document. A link to run examples
implies that there's R running somewhere, which cannot be guaranteed by
the time the human-readable document is opened by the human.

One way around this problem would be to embed a copy of webR [*] in the
document so that R would run in the browser. This involves a
significant developer effort and would either bloat your vignette to
the size of an R installation or make it depend on external resources
to load webR from (that could go away or spy on the user). webR is
still experimental; last time I tried it, it crashed the browser tab
when I invoked functions from the quadprog package.

Another way would be to add a hack to the vignette engine to start a
server at vignette rendering time, insert the link to this server into
the vignette as it's being rendered and hope that the server is still
running by the time the vignette is opened. This would require the user
to re-render the vignette every time they restart the server.

Technically, one could also invent a completely new kind of vignette
engine that would output self-contained executable files with a
document rendering engine and R built in, so that a click on the "Run
examples" would use that built-in R. This is basically the webR
solution without the web and with a lot of extra pain.

You could also fake some of it by writing extra JavaScript (with the
help of third-party statistics libraries, e.g. [**]) to do the same
thing in the browser as is done in R, but that's still a lot of work
for little benefit.

Yet another way would be to make these links point to an external
service somewhere on the Internet that would run the R code. Since R is
not designed to work with untrusted input (not to mention untrusted
users entering code), that would be an informational security nightmare
both on your side (R would have to run in locked-down read-only
disposable virtual machines hardened against sandbox escape and
privilege escalation exploits) and on the GDPR side of things.

There are doubtlessly more approaches, but I think they would all be
this convoluted or worse.

Others have explained why this is hard.  An alternative might be to run 
the examples when you produce your vignette, but hide the results until 
a button is pressed to display them.

Dear Ivan,

Thanks for these pointers!
I think with your script, reading through the docs and some other packages
structures I sort of made sense of things (the dynamic configure options
are new to me).
I hope this will now resolve the system specific dependencies.

Appreciate the help!
Cheers,
K

Message-ID: <CO1PR11MB51226E7B80B9B903DEE3BA32B78EA@CO1PR11MB5122.namprd11.prod.outlook.com>

We include other software in our source code. It has some long paths so a few of the files end up with paths longer than 100 bytes, and we need to manually rename them whenever we pull in updates.

The 100 byte path limit is from tar v7, and since POSIX1.1988, there has not been a path length limit. That standard is 35 years old now, so given that there is probably no one using an old version of tar that also wants to use the latest version of R, could the 100 byte limit be lifted? Incidentally, I am a big proponent of wide, long-term support, but it's hard to see that this change would negatively impact anyone.

Best wishes,
Justin

Wrong mailing list:

This is a topic for R-devel,  not at all R-package-devel,
but be more accurate in what you are talking about, only between
the line I could read that it is about some variants of using
'tar'.

When submitting a package to CRAN, it is required that path names be shorter than 100 bytes, with the reason that paths longer than that cannot be made into portable tar files. This error is reported by `R CMD check --as-cran`. Since this pertains only to developing packages, this seemed like the appropriate list, but if you don't think so, I can instead ask on R-devel.

Best wishes,
Justin

Wrong mailing list:

This is a topic for R-devel,  not at all R-package-devel,
but be more accurate in what you are talking about, only between
the line I could read that it is about some variants of using
'tar'.

Justin,

now that you clarified what you are actually talking about, this is a question about the CRAN policies, so you should really direct it to the CRAN team as it is their decision (R-devel would be appropriate if this was a limitation in R itself, and R-package-devel would be appropriate if you wanted help with refactoring to adhere to the policy). There are still path limits on various platforms (even if they are becoming more rare), so I'd personally question the source rather than the policy, but then your email was remarkably devoid of any details.

Cheers,
Simon

  FWIW the R-windows FAQ says:

Yet another complication is a 260 character limit on the length of the 
entire path name imposed by Windows. The limit applies only to some 
system functions, and hence it is possible to create a long path using 
one application yet inaccessible to another. It is sometimes possible to 
reduce the path length by creating a drive mapping using subst and 
accessing files via that drive. As of Windows 10 version 1607 and R 4.3, 
one can remove this limit via Windows registry by setting 
Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem\LongPathsEnabled 
to 1. Long paths still may not always work reliably: some applications 
or packages may not be able to work with them and Windows cannot execute 
an application with long path as the current directory.

   I'm having trouble finding the specific check for path lengths > 100 
in the R source tree.  It would be helpful to have the exact wording of 
the NOTE/WARNING (?) that is thrown ...  (I know I could make my own 
mini-package with a long path length in it somewhere but ...)

I don't know what the warning looks like, but the ?tar help page 
discusses the issues.

   Thanks. Pursuing this a bit further, from ?tar "Known problems":

  The handling of file paths of more than 100 bytes.  These
were unsupported in early versions of ?tar?, and supported in
one way by POSIX ?tar? and in another by GNU ?tar? and yet
another by the POSIX ?pax? command which recent ?tar?
programs often support.  The internal implementation warns on
paths of more than 100 bytes, uses the ?ustar? way from the
1998 POSIX standard which supports up to 256 bytes (depending
on the path: in particular the final component is limited to
100 bytes) if possible, otherwise the GNU way (which is
widely supported, including by ?untar?).

   This issue is reminiscent of the "invalid uid value replaced ..." 
warning, which has happened to me a lot but which CRAN has never 
actually flagged when I've submitted a package:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30599326/warning-message-during-building-an-r-package-invalid-uid-value-replaced-by-that

  (By the way, this thread now seems firmly on-topic for r-pkg-devel, 
even if the ultimate answers must come from the CRAN maintainers ...)

   cheers
    Ben

Hi,

when trying to update my package on CRAN it is rejected, because it gets 
a note during checks on Debian:

Flavor: r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-gcc
Check: for non-standard things in the check directory, Result: NOTE
Found the following files/directories:
'NUL'

There is no such file in my folder and therefore it can't be removed. 
With Windows everything is OK.
As far as I understood, this is a problem with Rhub? 
(https://github.com/clessn/locateip/issues/99)

Or what can I do, to fix this problem and get my package update 
submitted to CRAN?

Thanks,
Friedemann von Lampe

distance = distance, k = i, trymax = trymax, engine = "monoMDS",
autotransform = autotransform)), file='NUL')

https://github.com/fvlampe/goeveg/blob/db94c4a567eeac67b6df1df5a4f2d1aa771e629a/R/screeplot_NMDS.R#L76

On Windows, everything goes right and the output is redirected to the
null device. On Linux, the null device is '/dev/null', not 'NUL', and
this name doesn't hold any special powers, so the file with this name
gets created.

Use the base function nullfile() to obtain the name of the null device
in a portable manner. I think you can also not supply the `file`
argument and ignore the return value of the capture.output(...)
expression. This may be less efficient if there's truly a lot of output.

R CMD check --as-cran gives a WARNING if a path is not ustar compatible, and gives the same message as a NOTE if it is not v7 compatible.

The path in the example below is ustar compatible, but not v7 compatible.

***********
* checking for portable file names ... NOTE
Found the following non-portable file path:
  BioCro/inc/boost/numeric/odeint/stepper/generation/generation_controlled_adams_bashforth_moulton_really_long_file_name_one_two_three.hpp

Tarballs are only required to store paths of up to 100 bytes and cannot
store those of more than 256 bytes, with restrictions including to 100
bytes for the final component.
***********

The code is in library/tools/R/check.R. An equivalent test is performed by R CMD build in library/tools/utils/tar.R.

AFAIK, CRAN rejects a package regardless whether the message is given as a NOTE or a WARNING. ustar is 35 years old and is older than R itself, and thus anyone using R in the last several decades will have ustar support. Any path stored by ustar will be suitable for any common file system in use for the last several decades. Overall, if a path is supported by ustar, there is no reason to generate any message, even if that path is not v7 compatible. If the NOTE about v7 incompatibility is still desired, then could CRAN not reject packages for which the check reports a NOTE?

Best wishes,
Justin

Well, yes, in parts at least.

Originally, even when it did not seem clear, it mostly seemed about the
part of the  help(tar)  page you mention above  and the
implementation of tar() .. i.e.  R-devel.

... but it's not really important anymore now, and hence this goes only to you.

Best regards,
Martin

Please don't forget about what has been correctly mentioned on this 
thread already: there is essentially a 260 character limit on Windows 
(see 
https://blog.r-project.org/2023/03/07/path-length-limit-on-windows/index.html 
for more). Even if the relative path length limit for a CRAN package was 
no longer regarded important for tar compatibility, it would still make 
sense for compatibility with Windows. It may still be a good service to 
your users if you keep renaming the files to fit into that limit.

Also please do not share private emails on the list.

Thanks
Tomas

Rhub is not CRAN. Please include a link to your source package if you want help. If there is actually a bug in Rhub then this NUL error may not reflect the response you will get from CRAN if and when you submit.

The 260 char limit is for the full path. A package would be extracted in 
some directory, possibly also with a rather long name.

Call a cutoff number. 

Any move from '100' to '100 + N' for any nonzero N is a win. Pick one, and
then commit the change.  N = 50 would be a great start as arbitrary as it is.

The maximum path length supported by ustar is 255 bytes, and any path compatible with ustar is compatible with path limits for all file systems used by any operating system for the last several decades. Anything that is ustar compatible is compatible with all other requirements. There is no reason today to reject packages with ustar compatible paths that are not v7 compatible.

Best wishes,
Justin

Any path stored by ustar will be suitable for any common file system in use for the last several decades. Overall, if a path is supported by ustar, there is no reason to generate any message, even if that path is not v7 compatible. If the NOTE about v7 incompatibility is still desired, then could CRAN not reject packages for which the check reports a NOTE?

Please don't forget about what has been correctly mentioned on this
thread already: there is essentially a 260 character limit on Windows
(see
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://blog.r-project.org/2023/03/07/path-length-limit-on-windows/index.html__;!!DZ3fjg!-9O1ZyZet_W6lAzZI0JZDI27SKTG6H4M4E5zB9xFItNpCD-I-eH2xmFxJ10uU1WAy1JNb4EiygQzkDsHkO1chmsk4TKd$
for more). Even if the relative path length limit for a CRAN package was
no longer regarded important for tar compatibility, it would still make
sense for compatibility with Windows. It may still be a good service to
your users if you keep renaming the files to fit into that limit.

Also please do not share private emails on the list.

I'm not even asking for that. I'm asking for the decades old ustar comparability, which is 255 characters, at most. In practice it is slightly less than that. ustar is older than R itself. There is no one using R who doesn't have ustar compatible tar.

So can lift the limit from 100 char to 260 char ?

On Windows, packages will be in "C:\Users\[User Name]\Documents\R\win-library\[R version]\[Package Name]".

With a 150 byte limit, that leaves 70 bytes for the user name, R version and package name. That seems more than sufficient. If people are downloading the source files, that also leaves plenty of space regardless where they choose to extract the files.

This is a narrow view of the world. As has been mentioned here by Tomas, the issue at this point is that a very widely-used operating system does not allow the absolute path to be longer than 254 characters unless users make possibly-breaking changes to their OS configuration. If a user is currently working in a directory with a path that is 150 characters long, and you try to un-tar a package there, it will work. If they are in a directory path that is 170 characters long, then the un-tar will fail. They then have to do some research and discover that they have to share the total absolute path length with the package creators, and they become accustomed to working in directories with path length no longer than 154 characters.

Now you want to propose giving the entire path length budget plus 2 to the package developers. Not gonna happen. And Dirk wants 50 more characters. Then the user working at 150 characters tries to un-tar a package with paths 150 characters long and 150 user plus 150 package gets you to 300 characters and what used to work for them stops working suddenly.

I think a package developer can figure out how to shorten their internal paths easier than thousands of users can restructure their historically useful directory structures or break their existing software. I vote no to both of these proposals.

Eventually, Microsoft is going to virtualize running old Windows APIs, and once people migrate away from the old API then this stupid problem will go away. But as it is we are stuck.

In R (>= 4.2.0), the default R_LIBS_USER path has moved to under
LOCALAPPDATA, e.g. "C:\Users\[User
Name]\AppData\Local\R\win-library\[R version]".  See
https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rw-FAQ.html

FWIW, one workaround for too long paths on MS Windows is to map a long
path to a drive letter, e.g.

subst Y: 'C:/VeryLongPathToo/Users/JohnDoe/AppData/Local/R/'.

and then work with Y: instead of C:. We had to use that in some
projects with nested data folder structures. This approach is tedious,
and might require special permissions (not sure).

Thanks. Thankfully Ivan looked up the source package 
(https://github.com/fvlampe/goeveg) and his response previously on this 
list solved the problem for CRAN. I simply needed to change the argument 
from? 'NUL' to NULL. The package was now successfully submitted.

However, in R-hub the NOTE remains, which apparently is is one of their 
problems.
