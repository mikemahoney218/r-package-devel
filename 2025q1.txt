Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Removing packages files
Message-ID: <CAN+W6_sjx59W6hGGMyj565smnazws=uasSWbwEHEe7kXT+YLAQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

I am developing a package that will download some data, and I'd like
to store it locally to not recalculate it often.
The CRAN policy requires tools::R_user_dir to be used and "the
contents are actively managed (including removing outdated material)"
or using TMPDIR but "such usage should be cleaned up".

When loading a package there is .onLoad or .onAttach to fill or check
those files and other settings required for a package. Is there
something for when a package is removed?

I found some related functions like .Last or reg.fnalizer and setHook
or packageEvent but they are about closing a session or don't have a
specific event for when uninstalling packages via (remove.packages). I
appreciate any feedback, thanks in advance.

Best wishes and a happy new year,

Llu?s

Yes, those are described in section "1.5.3 Load hooks" of writing R 
extensions:

"Packages can use a .onDetach or .Last.lib function (provided the latter 
is exported from the namespace) when detach is called on the package. It 
is called with a single argument, the full path to the installed 
package. There is also a hook .onUnload which is called when the 
namespace is unloaded (via a call to unloadNamespace, perhaps called by 
detach(unload = TRUE)) with argument the full path to the installed 
package?s directory. Functions .onUnload and .onDetach should be defined 
in the namespace and not exported, but .Last.lib does need to be exported."

Dear Duncan,

Thank you for your answer. I checked again and made a mock package
that removes a file with .onDetach.
The file was not removed upon uninstalling the package.

As a first step, this sounds like something for the 'tools' package,
e.g. tools::cleanup_R_user_dir() that wipes package subfolders of
packages no longer installed, or the specified package, iff given.
With that in place, one could argue for adding a 'cleanup' argument to
remove.packages() that use the former.

Agree, it would be neat if a package could clean up after itself when
uninstalled.

Sorry, I misunderstood what you are after.  I thought you only wanted to 
keep it for the duration of a session.  I don't think there's a way to 
keep a file beyond the current session, but uninstall it later when the 
package is uninstalled.

I think the way you should handle this is to offer a function to the 
user to download the data to the user directory, not to ever do that 
automatically.  If the data hasn't been downloaded, then give the user a 
message that it needs to be downloaded for things to work.  (Or maybe 
download it to the temp directory, and delete it when your package is 
unloaded.)
