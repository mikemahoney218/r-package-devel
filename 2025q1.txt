Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Removing packages files
Message-ID: <CAN+W6_sjx59W6hGGMyj565smnazws=uasSWbwEHEe7kXT+YLAQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

I am developing a package that will download some data, and I'd like
to store it locally to not recalculate it often.
The CRAN policy requires tools::R_user_dir to be used and "the
contents are actively managed (including removing outdated material)"
or using TMPDIR but "such usage should be cleaned up".

When loading a package there is .onLoad or .onAttach to fill or check
those files and other settings required for a package. Is there
something for when a package is removed?

I found some related functions like .Last or reg.fnalizer and setHook
or packageEvent but they are about closing a session or don't have a
specific event for when uninstalling packages via (remove.packages). I
appreciate any feedback, thanks in advance.

Best wishes and a happy new year,

Llu?s

Yes, those are described in section "1.5.3 Load hooks" of writing R 
extensions:

"Packages can use a .onDetach or .Last.lib function (provided the latter 
is exported from the namespace) when detach is called on the package. It 
is called with a single argument, the full path to the installed 
package. There is also a hook .onUnload which is called when the 
namespace is unloaded (via a call to unloadNamespace, perhaps called by 
detach(unload = TRUE)) with argument the full path to the installed 
package?s directory. Functions .onUnload and .onDetach should be defined 
in the namespace and not exported, but .Last.lib does need to be exported."

Dear Duncan,

Thank you for your answer. I checked again and made a mock package
that removes a file with .onDetach.
The file was not removed upon uninstalling the package.

As a first step, this sounds like something for the 'tools' package,
e.g. tools::cleanup_R_user_dir() that wipes package subfolders of
packages no longer installed, or the specified package, iff given.
With that in place, one could argue for adding a 'cleanup' argument to
remove.packages() that use the former.

Agree, it would be neat if a package could clean up after itself when
uninstalled.

Sorry, I misunderstood what you are after.  I thought you only wanted to 
keep it for the duration of a session.  I don't think there's a way to 
keep a file beyond the current session, but uninstall it later when the 
package is uninstalled.

I think the way you should handle this is to offer a function to the 
user to download the data to the user directory, not to ever do that 
automatically.  If the data hasn't been downloaded, then give the user a 
message that it needs to be downloaded for things to work.  (Or maybe 
download it to the temp directory, and delete it when your package is 
unloaded.)

Thanks Henrik for confirming there is nothing similar currently.

Duncan: Letting the user choose when to remove the folder/data at will is easy.
I was trying to ensure that the system is clean after removing the package.
Thanks.

No, I was suggesting that you require the user to explicitly ask for the 
data.  You don't want CRAN to install the data during testing and then 
have it left behind at the end.

Indeed many things could be nicer if we had more package manager integrations
and hooks besides `cleanup` and `configure`.  Someone would have to start
with some patches to get the ball rolling.

The data is mostly CRAN's own files transformed, I don't expect the
download to be problematic on CRAN's checks.
The R core members made the functionality inside tools to use a local
variable to search for the requested file locally.
Only if the file is not found they are downloaded from the internet.

Regarding tests, I could disable saving the content to a file (Thanks
for mentioning, I hadn't thought about it).
But the functionality/utility of the package is to transform CRAN's data.
If it is failing to do so, I would like to know.

Dear fellow package developers,

A while back I have submitted a package to CRAN and is now listed under waiting <https://cran.r-project.org/incoming/waiting/openmpt_0.1.1.tar.gz>

As I understand it, incoming packages are listed there if CRAN needs more information from the maintainer. However, I have received no requests from CRAN. In the meantime it has been stagnant in the waiting area for about 22 days.

After some more testing I discovered that the submitted package violates CRAN policy (it does not exit gracefully when online resources are not available). Maybe this is why it is on hold. This has been fixed in <https://github.com/pepijn-devries/openmpt>, but has not been submitted yet. How do I proceed? I think I have the following options:

 - wait even longer for feedback from CRAN;
 - contact CRAN about the status of this package;
 - submit the latest version of the package in which policy violations have been addressed.

Any thoughts are welcome.

Pepijn

Dear Pepijn,

Thank you for the very detailed email.
Part of these 22 days might be explained by CRAN volunteers being on
vacations a couple of weeks, until yesterday.

I would submit the latest version of the package with the improvements you made.
Other options require more manual work from CRAN volunteers and/or more delays.
I'm sure they will appreciate you double checking CRAN policy to make
sure you comply with all the requirements.

To solve some common issues, there is a new resource co-authored by a
CRAN reviewer: the CRAN cookbook:
https://contributor.r-project.org/cran-cookbook/
I hope it helps.

Good luck!
Best,

Llu?s Revilla

PS: There are some issues on AmigaFFH package, you might receive a
message to update it.

Hi Llu?s,

Thank you for you thoughts on this matter and recommendations. I will go ahead to submit the revised version as soon as possible.

Cheers,

Hi Llu?s,

   Just wanted to add to the discussion that it would be good to consider 
users that are disconnected or behind a firewall and are installing the 
package from file.

   An option to point the package to a separately downloaded file would be
useful.

best
