It is rather presumptuous of me to comment, but for what it's worth I
personally would not ignore such a warning.  There is (it seems to me)
always a possibility that the warning is symptomatic of a problem that
could at some stage whip around and bite you on the arse.  I would try
to find out why the directory "vign_test" (unexpectedly?) exists.  Where
does it come from? Who/what created it?

If its possible existence is "understandable" perhaps you should test
for its existence (using file.exists()?) and if it does indeed exist,
don't try to create it.

Feel free to ignore me (and I'll go away! :-) ).

cheers,

Rolf

I agree the warning shouldn't be ignored, but I believe it was created 
by R CMD check, not by Spencer directly.  So the real question is:  why 
was it already there?

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] gettext on Solaris
Message-ID: <CAPRVBcxab6vLt+H+g7VgVROxSx4niEgFhKmJU2SkbFH4sC7g1g@mail.gmail.com>

My new submission potools failed on Solaris:

https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-patched-solaris-x86/potools-00check.html

Likely reason is that one or more of the SystemRequirements are missing (I
put gettext as a catchall in the DESCRIPTION but more specifically it needs
msgfmt, msgmerge, msginit and msgconv).

WRE mentions tests/examples should run without error when command-line
tools are unavailable, so I've added some escapes, but nevertheless I'm a
bit puzzled -- I expected these requirements would be easy to handle since
tools::update_pkg_po() has the same requirements.

Am I right that R's own default packages may be only partially functional
on CRAN checks?

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Change package maintainer
Message-ID: <CAFHOBwzuzE1Q67Pz+wavZdkAJbJPi8ejSqEYOZd2823F=fPkLA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there, I have recently uploaded the first version of my R package to
CRAN. As it is part of my final degree project, I need to change the
maintainer to my supervisor, now that I have finished the project.

I changed in the DESCRIPTION file the proper data to do so, but when
receiving back the email from CRAN the only NOTE I have is this one:

* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
Maintainer: 'Fernando Carazo Developer <fcarazo at tecnun.es>'

New maintainer:
  Fernando Carazo Developer <fcarazo at tecnun.es>
Old maintainer(s):
  Javier Garcia Developer <a905125 at alumni.unav.es>


What do I need to do here?

Thank you

Javier

1. Correct the name of the new maintainer whose family name is probably 
not "Developer". Apparently nobody spotted this in your initial submission.

2. After successful submission to CRAN, the old maintainer will receive 
a confirmation request which you have to respond to.

Best,
Uwe Ligges

Hi Uwe:

Is what you described the preferred way to change maintainers  (I have just taken over another package),  or would you prefer receiving an email from the old maintainer before the submission?

Thanks,

-Roy

Both ways are fine with us, but the auto confirmation request will be 
sent out in any case.

Thanks Uwe for answering,

I have a question related to changing maintainers.
What happens when the old/current maintainer does not respond to
emails or other methods of contact?
Would the new maintainer need to wait until the package is removed
from CRAN to submit it again?

Best,

Llu?s

PS: Not sure if my related question should be in another thread or not.

Not speaking for CRAN here but my understanding always was that a full and
complete 'email handshake' with both old and new maintainer was strongly
preferred / the default simply to prevent misunderstandings or shenanigans.

I'd agree in the normal case where the package is still active on CRAN.

In the case where a package has unaddressed issues with no response to 
CRAN from the maintainer, they'd probably be quite happy to have someone 
volunteer to take over.

Hi,

I agree that the email handshake is the best approach (and very
reasonable to expect it).
I thought that maybe in cases like this there was a waiting period
and/or multiple attempts to contact the maintainer and someone on the
mailing list might have had some experience with the process.
When I'm ready to take over the package I will ask the CRAN team and
give them more details.

Many thanks to all.

	  I can suggest one example: multcompView:  I created it during or 
before 2006 and passed it during or before 2011 to Luciano Selzer 
<luciano.selzer at gmail.com>.  I do not remember the exact process, and 
procedures could have changed since then.  However, I think I remember 
communicating with the CRAN maintainers after Selzer and I agreed he 
would take it over.  Beyond that, I see that the DESCRIPTION file for 
multicompView0.1-3 lists BOTH of us as Maintainer.  The version before 
that lists me only, and the one after lists him.[1]


	  Second, last September, Brian Ripley sent an email to 50 different 
people saying gdata had problems, the maintainer had not responded, and 
it was scheduled to be archived along with all its strong reverse 
dependencies on 2020-09-25.  I don't know what happened from that except 
that the package is still on CRAN with date Published: 2017-06-06, but 
my Ecfun package no longer uses it.


	  Beyond that, I'm pretty sure that anyone can adopt a package in the 
archives that is no longer on CRAN and resurrect it if you agree to fix 
the problems.  However, you should discuss with the CRAN maintainers.

Although, the CRAN policies require a single maintainer these days.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] ERROR: lazy loading failed for package 'movecost'
In-Reply-To: <774fb9ef-4e8d-4be7-8ef3-4d973d5f43fb@Spark>

Hello,

I am in the process of checking my ?movecost? package before submitting to CRAN.

As usual, I have tested my package locally (on my MAC) using devtools::check() and everything is fine, getting 0 error, 0 warnings and 0 notes.

Also, as I routinely do, I used (A)?devtools::check_win_devel(); in the returned email, the status was OK (https://win-builder.r-project.org/lWar6m662wl3).

BUT, I got 1 error from both:
(B) devtools::check_win_release() (https://win-builder.r-project.org/6ZzaipUr9rPF)
(C) devtools::check_win_oldrelease() (https://win-builder.r-project.org/yXHZoOCov7xH)

I cannot really figure out what is actually causing the error (Im not a specialist in programming and the like):
ERROR: lazy loading failed for package ?movecost'


Any hint/elucidation on the matter, so that I can spot what is causing the error, would be appreciated.
Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best
Gianmarco

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] R-CMD-check works locally and on github,
 but windows automatic checks fail
Message-ID: <CAApgGZdGbZqUmpVNr1wXZsd_na6+Vg7fAN1FkBZwLyf9TzRVqw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am trying to submit our package scDiffCom (
https://github.com/CyrilLagger/scDiffCom) to CRAN. However, it does not
pass the windows automatic checks for some unclear reason to me. Any help
would be really appreciated!

Basically, the output from R-CMD-check is fine locally and for the github
actions I specified, but not for the automatic windows tests. Please see
below:

------------
1)
no ERRORs, no WARNINGs, no NOTEs when running devtools:check() locally
(windows 10, R 4.1.0)

2)
no ERRORs, no WARNINGs, no NOTEs when running github-actions
<https://github.com/CyrilLagger/scDiffCom/blob/master/.github/workflows/check-standard.yaml>
for windows-latest (release), macOS-latest (release), ubuntu-20.04
(release), ubuntu-20.04 (devel)

3)
1 ERROR when running devtools:check_win_devel: *Running the tests in

to me, it only contains:

> library(testthat)
> library(scDiffCom)
>
> test_check("scDiffCom")
Loading required package: SeuratObject

4)
2 ERRORs when running devtools:check_win_release. As follows:

** running tests for arch 'i386' ... [5s] ERROR

  Running 'testthat.R' [4s]

-----------

Since I have no error locally on my machine, I don't know what I could
change for the automatic tests to work. Also, I don't understand why
the github-action for windows-latest (release) works but not
devtools:check_win_release().

By the way, I installed R devel on my machine in addition to R 4.1.0,
but it turns out I cannot test our package installation because it has
Bioconductor dependencies and "Bioconductor does not yet build and
check packages for R version 4.2" as reported here
<https://github.com/r-hub/rhub/issues/471>. The exact same error
actually also occurs when I run devtools:check_rhub(). It does not
seem to be related to the failure of testthat I reported above, but I
thought it might be useful to mention it.

Thanks in advance for any help/suggestions!

Cyril

That's the windows release version, not devel.

You didn't test windows-devel.

That's a Windows devel run.  That's what you haven't done locally.

You say check_win_devel() above.

Yes, seems related.  If you're depending on a package that won't build, 
your tests will fail.

Perhaps you can reduce your dependence to Suggests, which will give a 
note on the failure to load, but no more.

I don't know if this is under your control, but I believe R-devel will 
not support i386.  (Or is it the last version to do so?  I forget where 
I saw the news.)

Good morning,

I got stuck on what follows.
I have tested a new version of my package locally (on a MAC), and everything is fine.

I got mixed results using:
devtools::check_win_oldrelease() - STATUS OK (R version 4.0.5) -?https://win-builder.r-project.org/7qy6PL8C7ye7

devtools::check_win_release() - 1 ERROR (R version 4.1.0) -?https://win-builder.r-project.org/hlA15dFq5BdR

devtools::check_win_devel()??- 1 ERROR (R Under development (unstable) -?https://win-builder.r-project.org/uQ0LGZ7v0E5h

The reported error seems to be:
ERROR: lazy loading failed for package ?movecost'


I have asked a friend to run devtools::check() on his Win-based machine (running R version 4.1.0), and the test returned no problems (0 error, 0 warning, 0 notes).

Since I cannot reproduce the error neither on my computer nor on a win-based machine, I am at loss of understanding where the issue actually lies.

I would really appreciate any help and/or suggestion.

Best
Gianmarco

Hello,
Further to my earlier email, I think I have located a likely issue, and I would appreciate feedback.

I ran?devtools::check_rhub(), and somewhere in the flood of the output I got there is the following message:

Bioconductor does not yet build and check packages for R version 4.2

The complete report that I got from?devtools::check_rhub() is here:
https://builder.r-hub.io/status/movecost_1.2.tar.gz-cbda0dbe4d7a414498921e9ab2a54aaf


Any idea about how to proceed in order for me to get my package on CRAN?
I am noticing that I am not the only one experiencing that isse (https://github.com/r-hub/rhub/issues/471).

Best
GmA

What happens when you test it on winbuilder?
It is configured like the CRAN incoming checks and there should be all 
relevant packages available.

Hello,
Thanks for your reply.

I got mixed results using:
devtools::check_win_oldrelease() - STATUS OK (R version 4.0.5) - https://win-builder.r-project.org/7qy6PL8C7ye7

devtools::check_win_release() - 1 ERROR (R version 4.1.0) - https://win-builder.r-project.org/hlA15dFq5BdR

devtools::check_win_devel() ?- 1 ERROR (R Under development (unstable) - https://win-builder.r-project.org/uQ0LGZ7v0E5h

The reported error is to be:
ERROR: lazy loading failed for package ?movecost?

Since I couldn?t understand the actual underlying issue, I ran?devtools::check_rhub() (as described in my earlier email) which brought to the fore the Bioconductor issue.

I have tested the package on Win (R version 4.1) and everything was fine.

I hope I have addressed your question.
Please let me know if you need any other relevant info from my end.

Best
Gm

I think the Bioconductor error on R-hub is a red herring. The error
message is printed, but the actual error is ignored. So this is really
only an issue if you do need a Bioconductor package for the check.

I think the issue might be that for R-devel CRAN binaries are x64
only, but R CMD INSTALL and R CMD check still try to install the
package for i386 as well. Dependencies (e.g. chron in this case) will
not be available on i386.

At least this is the issue for R-hub, because it uses CRAN binaries by
default: https://artifacts.r-hub.io/movecost_1.2.tar.gz-cbda0dbe4d7a414498921e9ab2a54aaf/movecost.Rcheck/00install.out

AFAICT Win-builder has its own package library, which might have i386
support, I don't know. So maybe the issue is different there.

For the lazy loading error, if you are not intentionally lazy loading data, you should remove the lazy loading entry from the description file.  Previously this was not causing any problems with the CRAN checks, but now it is.

Hello,
Thanks for your reply.

I got mixed results using:
devtools::check_win_oldrelease() - STATUS OK (R version 4.0.5) - https://win-builder.r-project.org/7qy6PL8C7ye7

devtools::check_win_release() - 1 ERROR (R version 4.1.0) - https://win-builder.r-project.org/hlA15dFq5BdR

devtools::check_win_devel()  - 1 ERROR (R Under development (unstable) - https://win-builder.r-project.org/uQ0LGZ7v0E5h

The reported error is to be:
ERROR: lazy loading failed for package ?movecost?

Since I couldn?t understand the actual underlying issue, I ran devtools::check_rhub() (as described in my earlier email) which brought to the fore the Bioconductor issue.

I have tested the package on Win (R version 4.1) and everything was fine.

I hope I have addressed your question.
Please let me know if you need any other relevant info from my end.

Best
Gm

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] weird C stack traces from win-builder,
 due to brms/rstan load?
Message-ID: <8263f0ef-c0e3-58cd-0ee8-ab3fa409d1f0@mcmaster.ca>

  I'm running into trouble checking a new release of the 'broom.mixed' 
package <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/broom.mixed/index.html> 
on win-builder.  I think it is some kind of rstan problem.

   The broom.mixed package loads the brms package, and loads several 
pre-computed objects from the brms package; I don't think it actually 
tries to run anything of the functions from brms during the check process.

   At several points during checking (see 
<https://win-builder.r-project.org/LsDDMqpnX52n/00check.log>), I get 
voluminous "C stack trace" outputs: once when "Checking dependencies in 
R code", once when calling require(brms) as part of an example, once 
when running the tests (not easy to determine the precise location, and 
once when building the vignettes).

   The trace starts like this:

==== C stack trace ===============================

	SETCAR [0x0x6c838a90+32]
	ZN4Rcpp8CppClassC1EPNS_6ModuleEPNS_10class_BaseERNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE [0x0x6ac093ff+1151]
	ZN4Rcpp6Module12classes_infoEv [0x0x6ac07467+327]
	Z20Module__classes_infoP7SEXPREC [0x0x6abe1c4a+74]
	Rf_NewFrameConfirm [0x0x6c7a7d18+33960]
	R_initAssignSymbols [0x0x6c7f3259+53849]
	Rf_eval [0x0x6c7fcd31+369]
...

   and goes on for a while.

   R CMD check runs fine on Linux with recent r-devel.

   Has anyone seen this?  Other than scrubbing all references to brms 
and rstan (a second try with one of the brms references avoided instead 
runs into trouble when loading rstan ...), I don't see what I can do ...

<https://win-builder.r-project.org/YArr24tuYZ8G/00check.log>

   cheers

What error do you get before the stack trace?

The Z... names look like C++ entry points to overloaded functions or 
methods.  There's a command line function (c++filt) that will usually 
turn those into their original readable form.  It's not working for me 
on the names you've got; maybe because I'm on a Mac, and that was 
compiled on Windows.  Perhaps someone else knows how to demangle those 
names?

   No obvious errors at all before the stack trace. I'm pretty sure that 
the stack trace is caused by the *act of loading the rstan package*.

   I guess the next thing to do would be to make a dummy package that 
does *nothing* but try to load rstan ... ?

=---

Here's the start of the text the first time this appears:

* checking dependencies in R code ... NOTE

   Here is another example:

I think the stack trace is omitting the initial underscore in the symbol

Hello,
Thank you all for the suggestions.

I am starting being a bit worried because I seem not being able to fix the issue.

I have never experienced issues with this package (movecost);
the last new version I have released to CRAN was released a couple of weeks ago with no issue whatsoever.

The new version I am trying to get on CRAN has just one difference: the ?chorn??package?has been added to the dependencies.
Now, I have tried to drop that new dependency, and I have run the tests. Same result.
The test using?devtools::check_win_release() and?devtools::check_win_devel() both return 1 error (lazy loading failed for package ?movecost?)

The test using?devtools::check_win_oldrelease() is OK.


I also tried to keep the new dependency and to drop the lazy download instead (in DESCRIPTION I have put?LazyData: false). I got the same results as above.

The package checks perfectly on my MAC, and checked perfectly when I asked a Win users to test the package on his PC (with the latest version of R).


I am really scratching my head.

Best

Did you try completely removing the LazyData line from the description file?

Hello,
Thanks for your reply.

I got mixed results using:
devtools::check_win_oldrelease() - STATUS OK (R version 4.0.5) - https://win-builder.r-project.org/7qy6PL8C7ye7

devtools::check_win_release() - 1 ERROR (R version 4.1.0) - https://win-builder.r-project.org/hlA15dFq5BdR

devtools::check_win_devel() - 1 ERROR (R Under development (unstable) - https://win-builder.r-project.org/uQ0LGZ7v0E5h

The reported error is to be:
ERROR: lazy loading failed for package ?movecost?

Since I couldn?t understand the actual underlying issue, I ran devtools::check_rhub() (as described in my earlier email) which brought to the fore the Bioconductor issue.

I have tested the package on Win (R version 4.1) and everything was fine.

I hope I have addressed your question.
Please let me know if you need any other relevant info from my end.

The complete report that I got from devtools::check_rhub() is here:
https://builder.r-hub.io/status/movecost_1.2.tar.gz-cbda0dbe4d7a4144
98921e9ab2a54aaf


Any idea about how to proceed in order for me to get my package on CRAN?
I am noticing that I am not the only one experiencing that isse (https://github.com/r-hub/rhub/issues/471).

Good morning,

I got stuck on what follows.
I have tested a new version of my package locally (on a MAC), and everything is fine.

I got mixed results using:
devtools::check_win_oldrelease() - STATUS OK (R version 4.0.5) -
https://win-builder.r-project.org/7qy6PL8C7ye7

devtools::check_win_release() - 1 ERROR (R version 4.1.0) -
https://win-builder.r-project.org/hlA15dFq5BdR

devtools::check_win_devel() - 1 ERROR (R Under development
(unstable) - https://win-builder.r-project.org/uQ0LGZ7v0E5h

The reported error seems to be:
ERROR: lazy loading failed for package ?movecost'


I have asked a friend to run devtools::check() on his Win-based machine (running R version 4.1.0), and the test returned no problems (0 error, 0 warning, 0 notes).

Since I cannot reproduce the error neither on my computer nor on a win-based machine, I am at loss of understanding where the issue actually lies.

I would really appreciate any help and/or suggestion.

Best
Gianmarco

Thanks.  It doesn't work for me with the leading underscore, but I'm 
using a clang based compiler, not gcc, so maybe that explains it.  (I've 
tried most of the --format= options, without success.)

Hello,
Thank you.
Yes I just tried that option, but I still get the same ?error:

Dear David,

where did you get this "idea" that 'LazyData'  is not good  for
 R 4.1.0 and newer ?

R's own  {datasets} package  *does* use lazyloading, and so do
most (formally) recommended packages, and I think most packages
I (co-)maintain, i.e., around two dozen CRAN packages do use
lazyloaded data.

---
*) The `Matrix` package is a big exception with 'Lazyload: No'
because its datasets partly are (S4-) classed objects from the package
itself, and -- as the "WRE" ('Writing R Extensions') manual
states -- package datasets must not *need* the package itself when
they should be lazy loaded.

Martin:

What I suggested was he remove the LazyData entry from the description file
if he was NOT lazy loading data.  If someone is lazy loading data, then that
is a different situation, and they obviously need to set the entry. 

But clearly Gm has a different problem.  He has now tried "LazyData: true",
"LazyData: false", and removing the LazyData entry entirely.  And he is
still getting this error:  

* installing *source* package 'movecost' ...
** using staged installation
** R
** data
** byte-compile and prepare package for lazy loading
ERROR: lazy loading failed for package 'movecost'
* removing 'd:/RCompile/CRANguest/R-release/lib/movecost'


So changing the description entry isn't helping.  Maybe someone else has a
suggestion of what to try next.


David

FWIW I think this is lazy loading of the code, which I think is
 different to what LazyData controls.? This is described in 
R-Internals:

https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-ints.html#Lazy-loading

I know nothing about it so I will not comment further.

Best,

B.

Thank you all. I appreciate your help and discussion so far.

To complicate the matter further, I have done an experiment. I have tried to test a new version which is 99.9% identical to the last official one on CRAN because I wanted to understand if the issue was with some??new code added to the version I have been testing in the last couple of days.

The new version 1.2 (virtually identical to the 1.1 on CRAN) did not pass the tests as per my earlier description. Same errors. The only Ok is on my computer and with devtools? winoldrealeases()

I really don?t know that to do next.

Best
Gm

FWIW I'm having the same issue with package NetLogoR (
https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/NetLogoR/)

Passing windows tests locally but code can't be lazy loaded on winbuilder,
except for oldrel.

Both NegLogoR and movecost have a lot of hard dependencies -- so many 
that I'm unwilling to install them with the limited bandwidth that I 
have right now.  I suspect that's related to the problem:  some 
dependency install is failing, and that causes something else to fail, 
and that leads to the not-very-informative failure messages.

This kind of problem is quite a lot of work to debug.  If I were going 
to attempt to do it, I would go for a bisection strategy:

  - Do you have any old revision which succeeds?  If so, use bisection 
on the revisions until you find the change which first triggers the error.

  - Perhaps no versions succeed, because something external to your 
package has triggered the error.  In this case, bisection would work on 
the dependencies:  cut out half of the dependencies and all the code 
that depends on those.  Have you fixed the error?  If so, add back half 
of the dependencies, otherwise cut out half of the remaining ones.

  - If you're still getting the errors after cutting out all of the 
dependencies, then start cutting out code and data. Etc.

In any case, try to find a version of the package that doesn't trigger 
the error, and a minimal change to it that does.  Then perhaps you'll 
understand the root cause of the error.

Thanks for the suggestion Duncan.

The same code version ran on winbuilder last week, but it's broken this
week.

I'll compare the dependencies between the two packages and focus on those
used by both for now, to see if it's caused by a broken dependency.

If that happened with a released version of R, then it could be that 
some new package version is causing the problem, or it could be a 
transient problem on Winbuilder.

Devel versions of R change every day, so there are more possibilities 
for origins of the problem there.

I also get from Winbuilder:

** byte-compile and prepare package for lazy loading
ERROR: lazy loading failed for package 'secr'

even for the tar.gz of the version secr 4.4.4 that currently passes all checks on CRAN. Perhaps it is significant that secr also imports from raster that had a new version on CRAN 18th June.

If that happened with a released version of R, then it could be that
some new package version is causing the problem, or it could be a
transient problem on Winbuilder.

Devel versions of R change every day, so there are more possibilities
for origins of the problem there.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] clarification about missing suggested packages.
Message-ID: <d2147327-163e-75eb-d288-52c245ec248b@gmail.com>


   We are working on a resubmission of a package 
(https://github.com/glmmTMB/glmmTMB/issues/721 for people who want all 
the gory details). Our last hurdle is that one of the packages in 
"Suggests:", DHARMa, is currently unavailable on Solaris, even though it 
in good standing on CRAN 
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DHARMa/index.html>. (This stems 
from a circular dependency: DHARMa can't be built on Solaris because the 
_previous_ version of glmmTMB, which DHARMa imports, had a bug on 
Solaris ...)

   We have been testing on r-hub's solaris platform, where DHARMa is 
similarly unavailable. We can only pass tests if we set 
_R_CHECK_FORCE_SUGGESTS_=false; otherwise we get an error that says some 
suggested packages are missing.

   It is my understanding that the CRAN maintainers can either

    * test with _R_CHECK_FORCE_SUGGESTS_=false and yell at us if we have 
used any missing/unavailable packages unconditionally or

    * test with _R_CHECK_FORCE_SUGGESTS_=true and ensure that all 
suggested packages are installed

but that it would be unreasonable to reject package A because it has a 
Suggests: dependency on package B that is in good standing on CRAN but 
is not available on a particular CRAN testing platform, as long as 
package A only uses package B conditionally.

   Thoughts/opinions/evidence?

   cheers
     Ben Bolker

 From the current CRAN policy:

     Packages on which a CRAN package depends should be available from a 
mainstream repository: if any mentioned in ?Suggests? or ?Enhances? 
fields are not from such a repository, where to obtain them at a 
repository should be specified in an ?Additional_repositories? field of 
the DESCRIPTION file (as a comma-separated list of repository URLs) or 
for other means of access, described in the ?Description? field.

     A package listed in ?Suggests? or ?Enhances? should be used 
conditionally in examples or tests if it cannot straightforwardly be 
installed on the major R platforms. (?Writing R Extensions? recommends 
that they are always used conditionally.)

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] invalid DOIs
Message-ID: <AM0PR0102MB3267F44650383BDD43CBE81FF71B9@AM0PR0102MB3267.eurprd01.prod.exchangelabs.com>

Hello everyone,

I'm updating the R package image.textlinedetector which is already on CRAN.
When doing R CMD check on winbuilder. I receive the note:

Found the following (possibly) invalid DOIs:
  DOI: 10.1117/12.704538
    From: DESCRIPTION
    Status: Internal Server Error
    Message: 500

The relevant part in the DESCRIPTION file which caused this note looks like this:
... by Arivazhagan M. et al (2007) <doi:10.1117/12.704538>, and a wrapper for an image segmentation ...

This DOI hasn't changed and CRAN seems to parse it fine as the link is shown at the DESCRIPTION of the web page of the package at https://cran.r-project.org/package=image.textlinedetector
How to solve this? What is the correct doi to put in here?

many thanks for your help,
Jan

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Error uploading package to CRAN that depends on
 packages hosted in GitHub
Message-ID: <CADZW5XGFdmcGn7WHG5+kYu+xAk8H=rznpen9jAcnippPG_kdaQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everybody,

I developed an R package that depends on packages hosted in GitHub.
In the DESCRIPTION file, I added the R packages (from GitHub ) in the
"Suggests" section and I included a copy of them in my personal GitHub so
they can be accessed in the "Additional_repositories:" section.


Suggests:
    rmarkdown,
    ANTsR,
    ANTsRCore,
    ITKR,
    extrantsr,
    MNITemplate,
    RAVEL
Imports:
    knitr,
    oro.nifti,
    fslr,
    neurobase
Depends:
    R (>= 3.5)
Additional_repositories: https://davidpayares.github.io/drat


A copy of the R packages my package needs is in
https://davidpayares.github.io/drat .
When I submit the package to CRAN, I get this error:


Suggests or Enhances not in mainstream repositories:
    ANTsR, ANTsRCore, ITKR, extrantsr, MNITemplate, RAVEL
  Availability using Additional_repositories specification:
    ANTsR         yes   https://davidpayares.github.io/drat
    ANTsRCore     yes   https://davidpayares.github.io/drat
    ITKR          yes   https://davidpayares.github.io/drat
    extrantsr     yes   https://davidpayares.github.io/drat
    MNITemplate   yes   https://davidpayares.github.io/drat
    RAVEL         yes   https://davidpayares.github.io/drat

Flavor: r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-gcc, r-devel-windows-ix86+x86_64
Check: package dependencies, Result: ERROR
  Packages suggested but not available for checking:
    'ANTsR', 'ANTsRCore', 'ITKR', 'extrantsr', 'MNITemplate', 'RAVEL'

  Namespace dependencies missing from DESCRIPTION Imports/Depends entries:
    'MNITemplate', 'RAVEL', 'extrantsr'

I found that this is the correct way to add dependencies that are not
hosted in CRAN. However, I do not understand why it is not working. If
anyone could help me, I would really appreciate it.

Thank you so much.

Cheers,

David Payares

I think this one is the part causing the ERROR.  Without seeing your 
package I can't say for sure, but I would guess you have made some 
unconditional use of those three packages.  Since they are only 
Suggested packages, you can't do that.  Your package has to run even if 
they are not available at all.  (It may not have full functionality, but 
it shouldn't generate any errors in its tests or examples.)

As the message says: You likely have declared some import directives via 
the NAMESPACE file. In that case you have to import from a package and 
hence list it in the Imports field.

If the package is not available from a mainsteam repository and you want 
to suggest it only, you cannot import from it via the NAMESPACE file.

Best,
Uwe Ligges

importFrom(MNITemplate,readMNI)
importFrom(RAVEL,maskIntersect)
importFrom(RAVEL,normalizeRAVEL)
importFrom(extrantsr,ants_regwrite)
importFrom(extrantsr,bias_correct)

From roxygen2 directives like this:

Many publishers (one worse than the other) seem to have very flakey 
internet resources and web servers are poorly set up, hence simply 
ignore this.

Maybe the message should say "NAMESPACE dependencies missing from 
DESCRIPTION Imports/Depends entries" to make that even more obvious?

Dear All,
Thanks for the useful discussion.

After Uwe?s prompt, I have tested the package again, and everything is fine now.
Was it a CRAN issue?

Whatever the issue was, I am glad my new version is bound to be on CRAN soon (I have just submitted it).

Best
Gianmarco

Dear All,
Thanks for the useful discussion.

After Uwe?s prompt, I have tested the package again, and everything is fine now.
Was it a CRAN issue?

Whatever the issue was, I am glad my new version is bound to be on CRAN soon (I have just submitted it).

Best
Gianmarco

even for the tar.gz of the version secr 4.4.4 that currently passes all checks on CRAN. Perhaps it is significant that secr also imports from raster that had a new version on CRAN 18th June.

Thanks for the suggestion Duncan.

The same code version ran on winbuilder last week, but it's broken this
week.

If that happened with a released version of R, then it could be that
some new package version is causing the problem, or it could be a
transient problem on Winbuilder.

Devel versions of R change every day, so there are more possibilities
for origins of the problem there.

Duncan Murdoch


I'll compare the dependencies between the two packages and focus on
those used by both for now, to see if it's caused by a broken dependency.

Both NegLogoR and movecost have a lot of hard dependencies -- so many
that I'm unwilling to install them with the limited bandwidth that I
have right now. I suspect that's related to the problem: some
dependency install is failing, and that causes something else to fail,
and that leads to the not-very-informative failure messages.

This kind of problem is quite a lot of work to debug. If I were going
to attempt to do it, I would go for a bisection strategy:

- Do you have any old revision which succeeds? If so, use bisection
on the revisions until you find the change which first triggers the
error.

- Perhaps no versions succeed, because something external to your
package has triggered the error. In this case, bisection would work on
the dependencies: cut out half of the dependencies and all the code
that depends on those. Have you fixed the error? If so, add back half
of the dependencies, otherwise cut out half of the remaining ones.

- If you're still getting the errors after cutting out all of the
dependencies, then start cutting out code and data. Etc.

In any case, try to find a version of the package that doesn't trigger
the error, and a minimal change to it that does. Then perhaps you'll
understand the root cause of the error.

Thank you all. I appreciate your help and discussion so far.

To complicate the matter further, I have done an experiment. I
have tried
to test a new version which is 99.9% identical to the last
official one on
CRAN because I wanted to understand if the issue was with some
new code
added to the version I have been testing in the last couple of days.

The new version 1.2 (virtually identical to the 1.1 on CRAN) did
not pass
the tests as per my earlier description. Same errors. The only
Ok is on my
computer and with devtools? winoldrealeases()

I really don?t know that to do next.

But clearly Gm has a different problem. He has now tried

Yup, our bad.

While we test against 2300+ reverse depends, we only test against them _under
the most recent versions we have seen_ which affects the Rcpp under test, and
we do not have an (explicit) test vector for these 2300+ packages tested
against everything built under the _CRAN_ version of Rcpp.  So the need for
one small adjustment slipped til we made it to CRAN, which caused this issue,
and one for broom.mixed (as we communicated off-list to Ben).

In short, no matter how large you try to span your test coverage and surface,
there will always be a residual chance for something slipping through.

"the narrower the window, the more likely you are to hit it."  :)

   In the process of trying to get a package to build successfully on 
r-hub's Fedora platform, I had to add a whole bunch of LaTeX .sty files 
to the vignette directory.  One of these was collectbox.sty, which 
triggers the NOTE

    So I put collectbox.dtx into the inst/misc directory in the package. 
Fine.

  Now, what do I need to do to (1) make sure that my DESCRIPTION file is 
correct and (2) hopefully, suppress the NOTE so I don't have to explain 
it to the CRAN maintainers every time?

* Do I change the LICENCE line (which is currently AGPL-3)? According to 
https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Licensing it would 
seem I would have to switch to "file LICENCE" (adding a 
"Licence_is_FOSS: yes"), where "LICENCE" contains something like

package code licensed under AGPL-3; file vignettes/collectbox.sty is 
under the LaTeX Project Public License (source provided in 
misc/collectbox.dtx)

? Should it say "file LICENCE" or "AGPL-3 + file LICENCE" ?

* Do I just include the files without comment, since I have complied (as 
far as I can tell) with the terms of the LPPL?

* Is there a way to signal to R CMD check that I *have* complied with 
the terms?

   cheers

I'll let others discuss the technical details of how to set up the licence
files.  I want to make sure you know that using AGPL is a good way to
ensure that nobody in tech uses your package.  Maybe that's intended, but
when I was at Google the ONLY software we were specifically prohibited from
using was code released under AGPL. I won't try to convince you of that
being a good or bad thing, but wanted to make sure you were aware of it.

For some projects that makes AGPL a good choice.  For example, the free 
version of RStudio is licensed under the AGPL, so there's some extra 
motivation for companies like Google to pay for the commercial license.

That probably doesn't apply to Ben's project, though.  It would likely 
require all copyright holders to agree on a second non-open license.

Dear R developpers,
I submitted my package on the CRAN and had this NOTE :

Found no calls to: ?R_registerRoutines?, ?R_useDynamicSymbols?

I added the output of the
tools::package_native_routine_registration_skeleton(".") function in a .c
file, updated the NAMESPACE with useDynLib(mypackage, .registration = TRUE)
and have no error on my local computer.

I don't know how to fix this problem as I cannot replicate it on my
computer. Is it just a false positive ?

Regards,
Ronan

It's unlikely anyone could help you with this without seeing what you did.

 Dear R developpers,
I submitted my package on the CRAN and had this NOTE :

Found no calls to: ?R_registerRoutines?, ?R_useDynamicSymbols?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In my package, called APIS, I wrote 4 .c functions all included in one file
: APIS.c

To avoid that NOTE message, I ran the command
tools::package_native_routine_registration_skeleton("."), copy the output
and paste it in a mypackage_init.c file.
Here is the output of the function :

#include <stdlib.h> // for NULL
#include <R_ext/Rdynload.h>

/* FIXME:
   Check these declarations against the C/Fortran source code.
*/

/* .C calls */
extern void get_individual_mendelian_probability_2n(void *, void *, void *,
void *, void *, void *, void *, void *, void *, void *);
extern void get_individual_mendelian_probability_3n(void *, void *, void *,
void *, void *, void *, void *, void *, void *, void *);
extern void get_mendelian_probability_2n(void *, void *, void *, void *,
void *, void *, void *, void *, void *, void *, void *);
extern void get_mendelian_probability_3n(void *, void *, void *, void *,
void *, void *, void *, void *, void *, void *, void *);

static const R_CMethodDef CEntries[] = {
    {"get_individual_mendelian_probability_2n", (DL_FUNC)
&get_individual_mendelian_probability_2n, 10},
    {"get_individual_mendelian_probability_3n", (DL_FUNC)
&get_individual_mendelian_probability_3n, 10},
    {"get_mendelian_probability_2n",            (DL_FUNC)
&get_mendelian_probability_2n,            11},
    {"get_mendelian_probability_3n",            (DL_FUNC)
&get_mendelian_probability_3n,            11},
    {NULL, NULL, 0}
};

void R_init_APIS(DllInfo *dll)
{
    R_registerRoutines(dll, CEntries, NULL, NULL, NULL);
    R_useDynamicSymbols(dll, FALSE);
}

----------
then, I changed all the @useDynLib APIS by @useDynLib APIS, .registration =
TRUE as recommended in
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42313373/r-cmd-check-note-found-no-calls-to-r-registerroutines-r-usedynamicsymbols

On my computer, it solved the problem and I do not have the NOTE message
anymore. However, during the CRAN submission process, I had this NOTE
message twice.
I do not know how to fix this as I cannot get the NOTE message on my
computer.

Regards,
Ronan

I think you got caught by a common misinterpretation of the auto-check 
output from the Debian machine. It **appends** the

Current CRAN status

at the bottom of the check log. So you see the check results for your 
submitted version and then, below, for comparison, the results for the 
package version currently on CRAN (which indeed gives the NOTE from 
checking compiled code).

Best regards,

	Sebastian Meyer

It's my understanding that the goal of the license field is to list
one license that the entire package can be distributed under (i.e. is
compatible with all licenses in the package). As long as you believe
that LPPL is compatible with the AGPL-3, then it's fine to keep the
license as AGPL-3.

I don't believe it would be correct to use "AGPL-3 + file LICENSE` as
R-exts only lists three uses of file LICENSE, none of which apply to
your case:

> If a package license restricts a base license (where permitted, e.g., using GPL-3 or AGPL-3 with an
> attribution clause), the additional terms should be placed in file LICENSE (or LICENCE), and the
> string ?+ file LICENSE? (or ?+ file LICENCE?, respectively) should be appended to the corresponding

> The optional file LICENSE/LICENCE contains a copy of the license of the package...
> Whereas you should feel free to include a license file in your source distribution, please do not arrange to
install yet another copy of the GNU COPYING or COPYING.LIB files ...
> Since files named LICENSE or LICENCE will be installed, do not use these names for standard license files.

> A few ?standard? licenses are rather license templates which need additional information to be
> completed via ?+ file LICENSE?.

I also recommend two additional changes:

* Include a LICENSE.note field that describes any parts of the package
that are available under other licenses.

* Add the authors of the included files to Authors at R

See https://r-pkgs.org/license.html#how-to-include for more details. I
haven't had any explicit feedback on these recommendations from CRAN
but they have worked for me in package submissions and align with my
(possibly flawed) understanding of CRAN policies and beliefs around
licensing.

  Thanks very much.  In the end I gave up and removed the offending
LaTeX files, as the goal of this was to get the package to build on
r-hub's Fedora platform, and it seems more promising to work with the
r-hub folks to get a sufficiently complete LaTeX installation
available there (as the required files seem to be present on every
_other_ Linux platform I've tried). (For future readers/references,
the  huxtable package is driving these requirements.)

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Spelling and manual CRAN inspection
Message-ID: <3dcbc0ce-9b58-fa9c-909e-f5348422b834@gmail.com>

Hi,

  ?I have been updating a couple of R packages this morning. One of them
triggered a manual inspection for "possibly mis-spelled words in
DESCRIPTION" for my last name (Coombes) --- even though none of the
other 20 packages that I maintain has ever triggered that particular
NOTE. A second package also triggered a manual inspection for
mis-spelled words including "Proteomics". (These flags only arose on the
debian CRAN machine, not the Windows CRAN machine, and not on my home
machines. And let's ignore how many spelling corrections I had to make
while typing this email)

*My question, however, is: why should this NOTE ever trigger a manual
inspection?* That makes more work for the CRAN maintainers, who I am
sure have better things to do than evaluate spelling. Anything that
would actually stop the package from working (mis-spelling a keyword, or
mis-spelling the name of package that is imported) is going to cause an
automatic ERROR and a rejection of the submission without making more
work for the CRAN maintainers. The other mis-spellings may reflect
poorly on the package author, but since they are NOTEs, it is easy
enough to get them fixed for the next round without making human
eyeballs look at them.

Best,
  ? Kevin

Spelling has different importance to different people. You are expressing a value judgement that differs from the values of R Core, but are presenting your opinion as if they are facts. My point is that your challenging attitude IMO makes having a conversation about those concerns difficult. (I am not associated with R Core in any way, and do in fact empathize with your frustration with the process.)

I think it is worth pointing out that spelling errors in the DESCRIPTION file are of greater significance than other areas of a package as they can affect assignment of responsibility and permissions, as well as reflecting poorly on the CRAN summary web pages. I suspect that problems with DESCRIPTION files in the past lead to this requirement.

I would encourage you to pause for a day or two before sending off messages like this in the future... a lesson I have learned the hard way myself.

Hi Jeff,

I think you are inferring an attitude in my initial message that wasn't 
actually present. I greatly appreciate the hard work that CRAN 
maintainers put in on behalf of the community. And I really did (and do) 
want to understand why some of their valuable volunteer time should be 
occupied deciding if "possible mis-spellings" are (a) real and (b) 
important enough to do something about.

I also admit to being possibly the world's worst typist. I often 
mis-spell multiple words in a sentence, and I rely on numerous spell 
checkers to point out the problems so I can fix them right away. (But 
right now, I am unhappy that the spell-checker in my email client 
insists that "mis-spell" and it variants doesn't have a hyphen in it.) 
So, I agree that correct spelling is worth someone spending their time 
on. But that someone (in my opinion) should be the package author and 
maintainer, not the CRAN maintainers.

Part of the issue is that the mis-spellings are reported from R CMD 
check as a NOTE, not a WARNING nor an ERROR. They don't affect the code 
in any way (unlike the consequences of trying to import the "grpahics" 
package -- boy, was that hard to type.). Further, most of the "possible 
mis-spellings" that I have seen flagged in my own packages are false 
positives. (As noted above; I use spell-checkers at several points along 
the way so I can correct them before I submit.) Moreover, the results 
from different spell-checkers (such as those on different CRAN machines) 
are inconsistent. That increases the probability that any package is 
going to get flagged with false positives and require manual intervention.

I don't know; maybe the CRAN maintainers like checking other people's 
spelling manually. But having to do that on a regular basis would soon 
make me run screaming from the room.

Best,
 ? Kevin

Message-ID: <CA+h+x0YnvqMnJ5srzv3uTY1QDhXGPVnnKqxxBj+2_uCQkZTFdw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am creating a new package `pacs` https://github.com/Polkas/pacs, which
I want to send to R CRAN shortly. However I am not sure about R
CRAN policy regarding scraping CRAN per package page with its archive.
More precisely I am fetching the data from
https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=%s and
https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/%s/ (downloading an old
tar.gz too).

Why I need this: I could read any DESCRIPTION files for any time point and
get a true dependency tree.  Moreover I could get a life duration of any
released package version, where shorter than 7 days are marked as risky. I
could compare a package min required dependencies difference before we
update it.  And much more.

I made a few notices like "Please as a courtesy to the R CRAN, don't
overload their server by constantly using this function." inside the
package.

Optionally If scrapping R CRAN from my package is a problem I will try to
build a separate DB with such data (updated everyday). Still any old tar.gz
has to be downloaded.

For what it's worth, I didn't see your message as aggressive.  But 
that's email:  it's hard to know the impressions people will get from it.

Regarding your point, I'd like to say (unaggressively!) that it's not 
your problem if the CRAN folks choose differently than you would in how 
they should spend their time.  One thing I can infer from past silence 
is that they don't like discussing such things here.

I have a list of words, acronyms and initialisms that commonly get flagged
as misspelled words when I submit updates. I generally just put an
explanation for each one in the "optional comment" section of the
submission form. It's pretty simple and seems to work out well.

If you need only DESCRIPTION, you can get it from github/cran - just open the file in any package and see how its web address is formed. There is a small delay between a package appearing on CRAN and it being mirrowed on github/CRAN though.

For caching strategies you could check, for example, revdepcheck (which does it on an epic scale).

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am creating a new package `pacs` https://github.com/Polkas/pacs, which
I want to send to R CRAN shortly. However I am not sure about R
CRAN policy regarding scraping CRAN per package page with its archive.
More precisely I am fetching the data from
https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=%s and
https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/%s/ (downloading an old
tar.gz too).

Why I need this: I could read any DESCRIPTION files for any time point and
get a true dependency tree.  Moreover I could get a life duration of any
released package version, where shorter than 7 days are marked as risky. I
could compare a package min required dependencies difference before we
update it.  And much more.

I made a few notices like "Please as a courtesy to the R CRAN, don't
overload their server by constantly using this function." inside the
package.

Optionally If scrapping R CRAN from my package is a problem I will try to
build a separate DB with such data (updated everyday). Still any old tar.gz
has to be downloaded.

That's an excellent idea. I can't resist pointing out that everything 
that was flagged this morning has been in those packages for years (and 
for multiple submissions), and has never been flagged before. So I would 
still have to update my master last this time around. And a human at 
CRAN would still have to spend time to check the submission comment 
against the NOTE.? (Hmm. Maybe the real underlying issue is that I'd 
like computers to make less work for humans, not more.)

Maciej:

There are other packages that query the CRAN site (cranlogs, etc.).  So it
seems the queries/fetches are generally allowed.  I can only find a couple
relevant mentions in the CRAN policies:


"Packages which use Internet resources should fail gracefully with an
informative message if the resource is not available or has changed (and not
give a check warning nor error)."

"Downloads of additional software or data as part of package installation or
startup should only use secure download mechanisms (e.g., 'https' or
'ftps'). For downloads of more than a few MB, ensure that a sufficiently
large timeout is set."


So it seems like what you are trying to do would be OK with the appropriate
cautions in place.  Obviously any test cases are going to have to run fast,
or it will get rejected for being too slow to check.

Just my reading of the policies.  Have never tried it.

Message-ID: <CAHoyoSLaLNqhG90U7eeWJufXv4duoMZFuf2eUAZ5jy3QLn=MQQ@mail.gmail.com>

My package, rbedrock (
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rbedrock/index.html), depends on
CMake to configure a dependent library. This works fine on most build
machines as `cmake` is installed and in the path. However, cmake is missing
on the machines that produce macOS  binaries. So I have two questions:

(1) Is cmake installed on these machines and I'm just using the wrong path?

(2) If not, is there anyone I can contact about getting it installed on the
MacOS images?

Thanks,
Reed

Could pkgsearch http://r-hub.github.io/pkgsearch/ help with what you're doing, as it can queries all versions of CRAN packages? See http://r-hub.github.io/pkgsearch/reference/cran_package_history.html for the docs of the function cran_package_history().

It does not scrape CRAN pages, it uses an R-hub API (that gets the data from CRAN so similar to your idea of building a separate DB :-) ).

Ma?lle.

For the record, the cranlogs package does not scrape or even just
download anything from CRAN or any CRAN mirror.

Note that the spell checks are not run by default in R CMD check. To 
trigger these, you need to set the (undocumented) environment variable

_R_CHECK_CRAN_INCOMING_USE_ASPELL_=TRUE

and have aspell (or alternatives) installed.

No worries about a potential pain of rechecking the same flagged words 
multiple times: Flagged words from the current CRAN version of the 
package are automatically filtered out (by default) if remote checks are 
enabled, i.e., if the environment variable

_R_CHECK_CRAN_INCOMING_REMOTE_=TRUE

(if unset it is TRUE for --as-cran). I'm sure the CRAN team takes care 
of that.

Anyway, if you would like to setup a dedicated dictionary for your 
package, this is also possible, see the "Watch Your Spelling!" R Journal 
article by Kurt Hornik and Duncan Murdoch 
(https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2011/RJ-2011-014/RJ-2011-014.pdf) 
and the details section in help("aspell-utils").

Message-ID: <CAB_Q2xK-pDFmU482YWWB6dzNC_M0dou9N3DZO4_D+4AF-JrtOw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I am working on an update to a package I have on CRAN called occCite. My
latest release attempt didn?t pass incoming automated checks, because there
is an outstanding error. Additionally, there are some weird notes I would
like to get rid of, if anyone has suggestions.

The killing error is in r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-gcc, which is: Packages
required but not available: 'BIEN', 'taxize', ?RPostgreSQL'

I don?t understand this, as it is the only system that throws this error,
and the packages mentioned are available via CRAN. Any suggestions?

Additionally, there are multiple platforms
(r-devel-linux-x86_64-fedora-clang; r-devel-linux-x86_64-fedora-gcc;
r-devel-windows-x86_64-gcc10-UCRT; r-patched-solaris-x86;
r-release-macos-arm64; r-release-macos-x86_64; r-oldrel-macos-x86_64) where
two notes pop up:

NOTE 1: Namespace in Imports field not imported from: ?bit64? All declared
Imports should be used.

The package does use bit64. Any tips on how to address this note?

NOTE 2: Found 6 marked UTF-8 strings.

I presume this is thrown because of the small sample dataset I?ve included
in the package, but why is it not thrown for all the platforms?

Thanks in advance for any help!

This kind of message usually arises when there is some problem with
those packages on CRAN. Indeed,

https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_BIEN.html
https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_taxize.html
https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_RPostgreSQL.html

the three of them have ERRORs in that platform. No issue on your end.
You reply pointing to that.

Are you sure? Your NAMESPACE file does not import(bit64) nor
importFrom(bit64,) anything.

Not all the checks are necessarily done in all the platforms. You can
silence this NOTE by converting the offending strings in your datasets
to ASCII and resaving them.

Or reduce your dependence on them to Suggests.  As it is, nobody will be 
able to use your package on platforms that fail to install any of those. 
  Are they essential to most of your package, or just a few functions? 
If the latter, then list them as Suggests instead of Imports, leave them 
out of your imports in the NAMESPACE file, in the functions that need 
them add tests like

   if (!requireNamespace("BIEN"))
     stop("This function requires the BIEN package.")

   # do things, with BIEN:: prefix on functions from that package.

and make sure your examples are also conditionalized.

You'll still get messages that they aren't available, but it won't 
completely disable your package.

I think the problem with RPostgreSQL/sec/RS-DBI.c comes from some changes
to Defn.h and Rinternals.h in RHOME/include that Luke made recently
(2021-07-20, svn 80647).  Since then the line
   #define s_object SEXPREC
in Rdefines.h causes problems.  Should it now be 'struct SEXPREC'?

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Using parallel:::sendMaster &c. despite warnings
Message-ID: <9AEB3219-D931-4BCA-A153-9E5005776F0E@precisionmethods.guru>

Because parallelized progress reporting in the futureverse.org incurs latencies too great for my application (https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/progressr/issues/118), I have found it necessary to implement my own progress reporting using some of the non-exported functionality from `parallel`. (I do appreciate that Windows lacks the fork() system call, and will not support this. But am willing to make this an OS_type: unix-only package.)

Of course, I get a WARNING for this:

?? R CMD check results ???????????????????????????????? precautionary 0.2.6 ????
Duration: 6m 41.8s

? checking dependencies in R code ... WARNING
  Unexported objects imported by ':::' calls:
    ?parallel:::readChild? ?parallel:::selectChildren?
    ?parallel:::sendMaster?
    See the note in ?`:::` about the use of this operator.
    Including base/recommended package(s):
    ?parallel?

Is this warning an absolute deal-killer on CRAN? Is there a 'correct' way to do `:::` that avoids the warning altogether?

Kind regards,
David Norris

AFAIK, you may use getFromNamespace to import non-exported function (e.g.
readChild <- getFromNamespace("readChild", "parallel") )
Although, I never use it myself for a package on CRAN

Concerning the unix only part, I don't know if it is acceptable or not,
If not, maybe it could be a good idea to have a package that can install on
all CRAN platform but to test OS and send a message to user whenever the
functionality is not available on its OS

Yohann Demont

The 'parallel' functions your package intends to access seem to be 
intentionally unexported. Their help page says: "They are not available 
on Windows, and not exported from the namespace", and "This is a very 
low-level interface for expert use only: it not regarded as part of the 
R API and subject to change without notice."

Correspondingly, the CRAN Repository Policy says

> Also, ::: should not be used to access undocumented/internal objects in base packages (nor should other means of access be employed). Such usages can cause packages to break at any time, even in patched versions of R.

which kind of answers both of your questions. The policy thus implicitly 
advises against using getFromNamespace().

I can confirm that getFromNamespace() does indeed circumvent the WARNING.
I might otherwise prefer ':::', however, for making its 'bad intentions' so clear.
I was very much aware of the cautionary language under `?readChild`, but wondered whether *in practice* more liberal community policies might be in force pending the maturation of the futureverse.
Although the sparse history of the relevant file hardly supports "might-break-at-any-time" alarmism, I do note that the last commit (in May 2020) introduced an argument sendMaster(raw.asis=TRUE) that I am actually using.
https://github.com/wch/r-source/commits/trunk/src/library/parallel/R/unix/mcfork.R

(Also agree with Yohann that ideally one might support Windows with a warning such as data.table issues regarding my Mac's non-support for OpenMP.)

Happily, package parallel is open-source. If you would like to make
use of the unexported functions, you could copy the source code with
acknowledgement into your package. Naturally this might be a lot of
work and risks different behaviour between your package and parallel,
but neither might be that terrible for you.  And certainly would be
better than trying to pretend that the functions you want are exported
from parallel.

There's a good chance that wouldn't work, because parallel is a base 
package.  Base packages can work with R internals and user-written 
packages can't.

Probably David's best course of action is to submit patches where 
necessary so that he doesn't need ::: access.  The original motivation 
appeared to be avoiding inefficiency in a contributed package; if 
there's a patch that can fix that, it could be available in a few days. 
  If it needs changes to the parallel package (e.g. exposing functions 
that are currently internal), that will take much longer, and needs a 
strong argument why the current API isn't sufficient.

Alternatively, he can go ahead and use :::, but just not expect his 
package to be on CRAN.  There are other ways to distribute packages.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] package upload failing with note about 'calibre'
 files in temp dirs
Message-ID: <ba93bcba-9f11-68fa-bb8f-6008c3b7adb2@skyeome.net>

Dear CRAN devs

I've recently run into some testing issues when attempting to release 
fixes for the ndtv package on CRAN.

1) I have examples in documentation that test the ability of the package 
to export files, but the creation of these files then results in a NOTE 
from testing.

For example:
 > export.dot(net,file="testNet.dot")


Flavor: r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-gcc
Check: for non-standard things in the check directory, Result: NOTE
   Found the following files/directories:
     'testNet.dot' 'toy_epi_sim.net'

Is there a recommended path/location that I can dependably write to that 
won't cause testing issues?


2) I'm getting a NOTE about tmp files that don't seem to be generated by 
my package:

Flavor: r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-gcc
Check: for detritus in the temp directory, Result: NOTE
   Found the following files/directories:
     'calibre_5.12.0_tmp_0xdbyqv2' 'calibre_5.12.0_tmp_1jl8jqpk'
     'calibre_5.12.0_tmp_5y0ez9_o' 'calibre_5.12.0_tmp_74yrardi'
     'calibre_5.12.0_tmp_94i7al75' 'calibre_5.12.0_tmp_ddddnxrg'
     'calibre_5.12.0_tmp_kspp394a' 'calibre_5.12.0_tmp_llj3v9l1'
     'calibre_5.12.0_tmp_n41oxz8a' 'calibre_5.12.0_tmp_nqsnylff'
     'calibre_5.12.0_tmp_o8q1up25' 'calibre_5.12.0_tmp_ou7_bpv1'
     'calibre_5.12.0_tmp_vcw1hd1w' 'calibre_5.12.0_tmp_xh0gp8d4'

I don't have any source code in my package that includes these file 
names, and searching on the web, it seems like it must be a reference to 
the a debian package for a "powerful and easy to use e-book manager" 
https://packages.debian.org/testing/calibre ?  This seems very unrelated 
to the functionality of the ndtv package, any ideas where these files 
are comming from?

Thanks for your help!
best,

You can write to the directory given by tempdir().  You may still get a 
note if you don't delete the files when you're done with them.

No idea about the other issue.

My understanding about this issue with progressr is that it is nontrivial, and will take author Henrik Bengtsson some time & thought to resolve.
OTOH if patches to 'parallel' were welcome, I could embed my solution in a modified version of parallel::mclapply by introducing 1 or 2 new parameters (e.g., mc.prog=NULL) to support progress reporting consistently with the existing interface.

There's a good chance that wouldn't work, because parallel is a base

packages can't.

Probably David's best course of action is to submit patches where 
necessary so that he doesn't need ::: access.??The original motivation 
appeared to be avoiding inefficiency in a contributed package; if 
there's a patch that can fix that, it could be available in a few days. 
??If it needs changes to the parallel package (e.g. exposing functions 
that are currently internal), that will take much longer, and needs a 
strong argument why the current API isn't sufficient.

Alternatively, he can go ahead and use :::, but just not expect his 
package to be on CRAN.??There are other ways to distribute packages.

??Naturally this might be a lot of
work and risks different behaviour between your package and parallel,
but neither might be that terrible for you.??And certainly would be
better than trying to pretend that the functions you want are exported
from parallel.

Is this warning an absolute deal-killer on CRAN? Is there a 'correct' way to do `:::` that avoids the warning altogether?

The 'parallel' functions your package intends to access seem to be
intentionally unexported. Their help page says: "They are not available
on Windows, and not exported from the namespace", and "This is a very
low-level interface for expert use only: it not regarded as part of the
R API and subject to change without notice."

Correspondingly, the CRAN Repository Policy says

Also, ::: should not be used to access undocumented/internal objects in base packages (nor should other means of access be employed). Such usages can cause packages to break at any time, even in patched versions of R.

which kind of answers both of your questions. The policy thus implicitly
advises against using getFromNamespace().

   Patches to parallel could certainly be *considered*, but people will 
probably want to argue about the details quite a bit.  I would suggest 
presenting/discussing your ideas for modification on r-devel before 
posting them as a 'wishlist' item to the R bug tracker. (If an R-core 
member participates in the discussion on r-devel and is convinced of the 
utility and harmlessness of your modifications the last step might be 
unnecessary).

Thanks for delineating r-devel vs this list, Ben, and for invitation to start a fresh convo over there.
I'll do that once I can exhibit a basic proposal functioning within package 'precautionary'.

Although the sparse history of the relevant file hardly supports "might-break-at-any-time" alarmism, I do note that the last commit (in May 2020) introduced an argument sendMaster(raw.asis=TRUE) that I am actually using.

Because parallelized progress reporting in the futureverse.org incurs latencies too great for my application (https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/progressr/issues/118), I have found it necessary to implement my own progress reporting using some of the non-exported functionality from `parallel`. (I do appreciate that Windows lacks the fork() system call, and will not support this. But am willing to make this an OS_type: unix-only package.)

Of course, I get a WARNING for this:

Is this warning an absolute deal-killer on CRAN? Is there a 'correct' way to do `:::` that avoids the warning altogether?

The 'parallel' functions your package intends to access seem to be
intentionally unexported. Their help page says: "They are not available
on Windows, and not exported from the namespace", and "This is a very
low-level interface for expert use only: it not regarded as part of the
R API and subject to change without notice."

Correspondingly, the CRAN Repository Policy says

Also, ::: should not be used to access undocumented/internal objects in base packages (nor should other means of access be employed). Such usages can cause packages to break at any time, even in patched versions of R.

which kind of answers both of your questions. The policy thus implicitly
advises against using getFromNamespace().

 Technical questions
Message-ID: <0ee817f8-8aed-1a71-8ece-d36547522147@gmail.com>

I'm working on a package called RNetica which links to a 3rd party 
library:  Netica.  Netica is available in both static (libnetica.a) and 
shared (libnetica.so) version (also Netica.dll for windows, but that is 
a separate topic).

I have a version of my package which works very well 
(github_install("ralmond/RNetica")), but it requires manually moving the 
`libnetica.so` file into someplace like `/usr/local/lib` where R will 
find it.

My preferences for how to deal with this are:

1) Figure out a set of flags to send to the linker so that R CMD INSTALL 
links against the static rather than the dynamic library.

2) Figure out how to add a line to the makefile so that `libnetica.so` 
will be copied to a directory where R will find it.  This is a bit 
tricky as a user without admin privileges may not have write permission 
on the proper directory.

I would be grateful for any suggestions.

 question
Message-ID: <d06923ad-7342-b19e-a1bc-e25ff8c4df33@gmail.com>

This is related to my previous technical question, but really is a 
question about CRAN policy.

I'm currently the maintainer of the RNetica package 
(https://github.com/ralmond/RNetica) which provides an R binding for the 
C API of the Netica Bayes net library (https://norsys.com).  The Netica 
library is available in both a "student" and "professional" version, the 
difference being a license code available from Norsys.  The student 
version is sufficiently functional to run the test suite and to be used 
for educational purposes.  Installing the package from github installs 
the student version, which can be converted to a professional version by 
purchasing a license code.

In the past, Norsys has been fine with me distributing binaries which 
included the Netica code (but not the license keys), and I'm sure that 
they would be okay with CRAN distributing student-mode binaries as well. 
  Currently, the source version will download the Netica API kit from 
the Norsys web site and install Netica (still working out one or two 
technical glitches).

What are the policy issues associated with distributing this package 
through CRAN?  My own code is licensed under the Artistic license (which 
is CRAN compatible), but the 3rd party shared library has a different 
license from Netica.  Can I distribute RNetica through CRAN or am I 
stuck with a github-only distribution.

Thanks for your assistance.

Building R packages against third-party C (or C++) packages is a common
topic.  There are a number of subtle sub-points here, and I tried to address
these in a recent-ish paper
   https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.06416
also available as a vignette in the Rcpp package
   http://cran.r-project.org/package=Rcpp/vignettes/Rcpp-libraries.pdf

An actual external (shared or static) library is a pretty tricky step. It has
been done a number of times before, see e.g. our Rblpapi package for use with
the Bloomberg API library ("free as in beer but not in speech" as no source
code) which we download at build time. That is a borderline case, in general
having source is better. Another case is deciding whether to use it as a
system library ("easy", "fast", less compilation; also less "reliable" as you
cannot control but users have) and/or embedding.  The database package span
the gamut there: sometimes the code is embedded, sometimes it is used as a
library on some platforms but locally compiled as part of the package and so
on.

It all depends. You may have a hard case if there are legal / redistribution
issues as per your other email.

Hello,

I have a question concerning the oncoPredict R package. I noticed this
package requires obtaining the .tar.gz file, then selecting the option to
install, and then  'Build Source Package' inorder to build the vignettes.

However, this isn't always the case with other packages. These require
installing from the .tar.gz file, but they don't also require building the
source package.

Why is building the source package required in some cases but not in others?

Any assistance would be appreciated.

Usually people include the built vignettes in the .tar.gz file, but if 
it was created with the --no-build-vignettes option, they won't be 
included.

If they are not included, you'll need to install the package to build them.

Some people create .tar.gz files for packages by methods other than 
running R CMD build (or equivalent functions).  Those may not be 
recognized by the R installer, so you would need to untar them, run R 
CMD build yourself, and then install the corrected tarball.

A package can have one or more licneses, but they have to apply to the 
whole package, otehrwise the componentes havbe to be distributed separately.

Also note that CRAN accepts FOSS licenses. This sounds like a case that 
CRAN will not agree to distribute the (non FOSS) binaries.

Hi,

What is the usual process to submit a new package to CRAN which has false-positive warnings?

I submitted rtree_0.2.0 last week (7/21). This package compiles with warnings from Boost headers. The warnings are expected, unavoidable, and unimportant, which I documented in cran-comments.md. After submitting the package, I got an email that the package failed the pre-test due to the warnings. I replied-all, pointing to the explanation in cran-comments.md. I haven't heard anything since, and the package is still in the archive folder at ftp://cran.r-project.org/incoming.

I'm new to this process. Is there something else I should do, or should I just sit tight and wait for a response?

win-builder results are here: https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/rtree_0.2.0_20210721_153225/Windows/00check.log

Hi Folks,

It appears that c++17 is not supported on all platforms used by CRAN. Is
there a workaround?

I have CXX_STD = CXX17 in the package Makevars file, but see
https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_kdtools.html

I assume if CXX17 is not defined, it is not available on that build owing
to the compiler. I'm curious to know if anyone else has solved that problem.

Thanks.

Actually I think the contents of cran-comments.md were included in the comments on the submission form. I used devtools::submit_cran() for the submission. It automates the form submission and IIUC copies cran-comments into the form. My comments are in the confirmation email I received.

Thanks Michael! So I should re-submit the package with the documentation on WARNINGS in the comments section of the submission?

Dear Kent

I think the canonical way to report these is in the space on the
submission form, unless I have not correctly grasped what you did.

Generally I'd sit for a week or so, then send a gentle reminder.  It's 
summer, and people are on holiday, so you might make that 10 days.

Regarding the issues:

Since one of them comes from the BH package rather than yours, you might 
want to talk to Dirk for advice about it.

The second issue you mention in your comment looks more serious:
"Found 'abort', possibly from 'abort' (C), 'runtime' (Fortran) Found 
'exit', possibly from 'exit' (C), 'stop' (Fortran) Found 'printf', 
possibly from 'printf' (C)".

Your response that you don't call  'abort', 'exit' or 'printf' isn't 
sufficient here:  those functions appear to have been linked in to your 
DLL, so somebody is calling them.  I'd try to track down those calls and 
see if there's a way to compile without them.

Thanks, Duncan,

I did consult with Dirk about the warnings. The #pragma in Boost headers which disables those warnings is not allowed in a CRAN submission, so he removed the #pragma, enabling the warnings.

I see that Boost does call std::abort in its error handling. I don't think I can do anything about that...

FWIW my package 'secr' has for some time had the same 'abort', 'exit' or 'printf' issue when checked locally on Windows. It is happily accepted by CRAN, and I have learned to ignore the local message. The only common element I can see between secr 4.4.5 and rtree 0.2.0 is that both import and link to Rcpp.

If you look at the BH page on CRAN, there are a ton of "reverse linking 
to" packages, i.e. packages that are doing something like what you do. 
It would be worth looking at a few of those that don't generate those 
warnings (e.g. abcADM, ACEt, etc.) to see if they're using the same 
parts of Boost as you're using, and have found a way to avoid the warnings.

The {anytime} package by Dirk Eddelbuettel uses {BH} and generates the same NOTE when I CMD Check it locally on Windows. It seems safe to ignore this NOTE.

But it generates no messages on CRAN:  OK all the way.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Question on proper methods documentation for R
 package with multiple S4 classes
Message-ID: <CWXP265MB047237D33CC51B66D3E33040EFEC9@CWXP265MB0472.GBRP265.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Hello,


We are trying to build an R package with more than two S4 classes that have common methods. However, when checking the methods part of the documentation for the second class, we see only the definition of the generic of the first class.


For illustration, we can call these two classes `Myclass` and `Mynewclass` which have similarly named methods `parameters` and `parameters<-`


```

#' Example docstring of Myclass

#'

#' @slot parameters_names names of the parameters which are used by the

#'     model.

#' @slot parameters parameters which are used by the

#'     model.

#'

#' @import tidyverse

#' @import reshape2

#' @importFrom methods new

#' @export Myclass

#'

Myclass <- setClass('Myclass',

                    # slots

                    slots = c(

                      parameters_names = 'list',

                      parameters = 'list'

                    ),



                    # prototypes for the slots, automatically set output and param

                    # names

                    prototype = list(

                      parameters_names = list('a', 'b'),

                      parameters = vector(mode = "list", length = 2)

                    )

)


# Setter and getter methods for parameters


#' Retrieves parameters Myclass.

#'

#' @param object An object of the class Myclass.

#'

#' @return parameter values of Myclass.

#' @export

setGeneric('parameters',

           function(object) standardGeneric('parameters'))


#' @describeIn Myclass Retrieves parameters Myclass.

#'

#' @param object An object of the class Myclass.

#'

#' @return parameter values of Myclass.

#' @aliases parameters,ANY,ANY-method

#' @export

setMethod('parameters', 'Myclass',

          function(object) object at parameters)


#' Sets parameters of Myclass,

#'

#' @param object An object of the class Myclass

#' @param value a named list of (a, b).

#'

#' @return Updated version of Myclass.

#' @export

setGeneric(

  'parameters<-',

  function(object, value){

    standardGeneric('parameters<-')

  })


#' @describeIn Myclass Sets parameters of Myclass.

#'

#' @param object An object of the class Myclass.

#' @param value a named list of (a, b).

#'

#' @return Updated version of Myclass.

#' @aliases parameters<-,ANY,ANY-method

#' @export

setMethod(

  'parameters<-', 'Myclass',

  function(object, value) {

    a = value$a

    b = value$b

    ic <- list(a, b)

    # if all above tests are passed, assign the ic namelist to the object

    object at parameters <- ic



    return(object)

  })

```

 and


```

#' Example docstring of Mynewclass

#'

#' @slot parameters_names names of the parameters which are used by the

                    # slots

                    slots = c(

                      parameters_names = 'list',

                      parameters = 'list'

                    ),



                    # prototypes for the slots, automatically set output and param

                    # names

                    prototype = list(

                      parameters_names = list('a', 'b', 'c'),

                      parameters = vector(mode = "list", length = 3)

                    )

)


# Setter and getter methods for parameters


#' @describeIn Mynewclass Retrieves parameters Mynewclass.

#'

#' @param object An object of the class Mynewclass.

#' @export

setMethod('parameters', 'Mynewclass',

          function(object) object at parameters)


#' @describeIn Mynewclass Sets parameters of Mynewclass.

#'

#' @param object An object of the class Mynewclass.

#' @param value a named list of (a, b, c).

#'

#' @return Updated version of Mynewclass.

#' @aliases parameters<-,ANY,ANY-method

#' @export

setMethod(

  'parameters<-', 'Mynewclass',

  function(object, value) {

    a = value$a

    b = value$b

    c = value$c

    ic <- list(a, b, c)

    # if all above tests are passed, assign the ic namelist to the object

    object at parameters <- ic



    return(object)

  })

```


It might be worth mentioning that keeping the generics for both classes led to problems in the `devtools::document()` command, as seen in the following StackOverflow question [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68113799/how-can-you-create-multiple-s4-classes-with-similarly-named-methods-in-r]


How could we solve this issue without having to give different names for the methods?


Many thanks,

Ioana

Hi Tim, if you look in the history of the mailing list there's been a few
questions surrounding c++17. But most of what I've seen is to have flags to
turn on and off the c++17 parts of your code. I get it, and not impossible
to do cleanly with boost macros, but kind of a bummer.  It would be nice to
have a larger discussion around CRAN c++17 based packages as now that the
windows gcc version is bumped up to 8 working in 17 seems much more
feasible. While most of 17 is "slice of life" features it's much nicer to
write imo.

Is Solaris the only system that does not yet support 17?

Section 2.7.3 'C++ Support' of the R Admin manual says, "C++ is not used by R
itself, but support is provided ...".  This is all stored from when R itself
is configure (prior to compiling) and override-able in package configuration
(Section 2.7.3 covers that) but as that in other places _it all depends on
what the user has installed in terms of C++ compilers_.

So packages need to test. R 4.1.0 ensure that _if_ C++ is present it is at
least C++11, R 4.2.0 (aka r-devel now) is currently set to roll this to
C++14.  Which is ... actually rather nice and way better than what had only a
few short years ago. But local system may still need to look after their
local compilers.  I still get bug reports from folks "blessed" with a
particularl Linux distro that seems to persist long enough so that people
aren't even yet at g++ 4.8 or 4.9 (though that environment has workarounds
too). Similarly even when R 4.2.0 comes our there will still be people trying
to build our packages on R 3.6.* or R 3.5.*. Such is life.

So in short, for my money, _assuming_ C++17 is present is still a wee bit far
out. Test for it, enjoy it when it is present and deal with it if not.

Kind of figured that out looking around on github. I added a config
(borrowed from one of your repos) to test for CXX17. I'm not sure its quite
working for me yet but I will figure it out. A couple of questions:

1) I had C++17 in the system requirements in the description file but might
remove it as I hope to make it check without CXX17. Does that have any
impact on installation or is it only informative/notification?
2) If we need to adjust a package currently on CRAN owing to platform
errors, should we keep the version the same or submit with a version bump?

Thanks.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Invalid URLs in Description Due to Redirection
Message-ID: <ED873E31-F076-4C84-B7D7-EF0AE93608A5@mathematik.uni-marburg.de>

Dear R developers,
I have several packages on CRAN and usually I can resolve all issues without bothering others in the mailing list. However, in this case I am stuck with the following note for 
my package https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=FCPS which enables access to over 60 clustering algorithms with consistent input and output:

?
Found the following 
(possibly) invalid URLs:
 URL: 
https://www.deepbionics.org/ (moved to 
https://mthrun.github.io/index)
   From: 
DESCRIPTION
   Status: 200
   Message: 
OK

Please change http --> https, add trailing 
slashes, or follow moved content as 
appropriate.
?

The URL  https://www.deepbionics.org/  redirects currently to gihub.io. My problem with the proposed solution in the note is, that I will probably move the website again somewhere else in the future.
Adding slashes did not resolve the note. For the current update, I just deleted the URL, but someday I would like to update my other packages or this one again. Hence, I have to solve this issue permanently.
Thus, I would like to be able to link the packages to a stable URL and not update packages every time, I move the website.
Does someone know, how to resolve this issue?
Should I use another redirection option in the settings of my hosting provider?
Should I implement an entry website using my hosting provider for deepbioonics.org which redirects the user after 5 seconds to the current website?

Best Regards
Michael

Well, the webpage reports Status 301 for permamently moved content. It 
should just be a redirection. Then you can keep it as is.

Well, there is no platform indepednet code for dealing with that field, 
but some parts may be scripted on parts of CRAN.

Any changes in new submissions need a new version number.

Clicking on the link (https://www.deepbionics.org/) it redirects correctly on my PC.  
If I understand Uwe correctly,
this is an issue with the setting of my hosting provider meaning to change the setting 301 to something else. 
Can someone be so kind to point out to me the right option for a correct redirection from the point of view of CRAN?
I have the choices
301, 302, Proxy, Frameset and URL anchor
and would tend to select frameset, but then only http instead of https is possible.

302 is fine.

Thanks Dirk and Uwe! Mostly thinking out loud, I wonder how open cran would
be to something where if C++17 is not available from the compiler a package
could

1. Have checks in the R code before the call to throw before the function
is called
2. Using macros so that if c++17 is not available you create a C++ function
that just returns something arbitrary but valid so everything compiles.

That feels a bit funky after writing it out but as long as things fail
properly idt it's an invalid pattern

There's also the alternative route like Eigen and Boost to query the
compiler for certain 14/17 features and make macros for those features. See
the example below for defining EIGEN_CONSTEXPR

https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen/-/blob/master/Eigen/src/Core/util/Macros.h#L766

This gives some niceties, but things like `if constexpr ()` and class
constructors with deduced templates go out the window.

We've thought about moving up to C++17 for the Stan math library, but we've
been kind of confused on what would make CRAN happy while requiring 17.
Dirk, I think you're right that "enjoy it when you can" is the best option
atm.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] can't reproduce 'Additional issues' on CRAN with
 valgrind
Message-ID: <LOYP265MB20158D7D223D1B8C6577D46CAEEF9@LOYP265MB2015.GBRP265.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

An update to my package rbibutils triggered 'Additional issues' on CRAN from valgrind, CRAN Package Check Results for Package rbibutils (r-project.org)<https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_rbibutils.html>.

However, running the checks with -use-valgrind  on my machine gives zero errors.
I am on Ubuntu (the latest stable version), my R-devel installation was updated earlier today and I rebuild it adding the
--with-valgrind-instrumentation=2 to the call to configure.
Valgrind coming with Ubuntu is 3.5.0, so I installed its latest version from  github (also no errors).

rbibutils has no dependencies, except that testthat is used for testing.

What am I missing? Do I need to have a separate library for the instrumented R-devel version?

As a side note, is there a way to find out if R has been built with valgrind? It seems that 'capabilities()' and 'R CMD config' do not offer this information.

Thanks,
Georgi Boshnakov

It doesn't look to me like you're missing anything, unless you start
seeing the errors when you start `R -d valgrind` and then run the tests
from your package.

Perhaps AddressSanitizer would be more successful at catching this
particular error? It should be possible run -fsanitize=... shared
libraries with "unsanitized" executables by LD_PRELOAD'ing libasan.
What happens if you run the following?

LD_PRELOAD=libasan.so.3 \
 PKG_CXXFLAGS=-fsanitize=address PKG_LIBS=-fsanitize=address \
 R CMD check rbibutils_VERSION.tar.gz

AddressSanitizer used to have an error where it couldn't start up if
something called malloc() before its constructors had a chance to run,
but it's been fixed in 2017.

realloc() does not initialize memory.  str.c contains a comment about
replacing malloc() with calloc() to avoid similar problems that valgrind
found.  It states that valgrind is mistaken, that that memory really is
initialized.  Hmm.

I also see the error about reading off the end of a malloc'ed array:

I changed my "Introduction.html" vignette's name to
"introduction.html", realizing only after the fact that CRAN's URLs
are case sensitive.

Would the solution of adding to my package's source a new
Introduction.html file pointing to introduction.html using a <meta

better solution?

Thanks in advance

I'm afraid I don't understand the issue here.  Other packages have 
vignettes named "introduction.html", e.g.

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rasterly/index.html

links to

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rasterly/vignettes/introduction.html

and it doesn't seem to cause any problems.  Why would you need a 
separate link to Introduction.html?

According to https://www.w3.org/TR/WD-html40-970708/htmlweb.html, "URLs in
general are case-sensitive", it's not only a CRAN thing.
Your vignette will be shipped with the package, hence if a user has a
case-insensitive file system (like macOS has by default), your workaround
would not work (see also Section 1.1 in "Writing R Extensions").

In my opinion the only solution is to fix the links, or go back to the old
case. There are plenty of tools around to replace all occurrences of
"Introduction.html" to "introduction.html" within your package. Of course
that doesn't work for all other links pointing to "Introduction.html" that
float around the web?

Best,

My question was in relation to the fact that my package has been
around for a while using this link:

https://cran.r-project.org/package=summarytools/vignettes/Introduction.html

which is now broken, since my last update (uploaded to CRAN a few days ago) uses

https://cran.r-project.org/package=summarytools/vignettes/introduction.html

So yes, I can revert to the previous Introduction.html, but I thought
a more flexible approach would be to add, when I submit my next
release, an "Introduction.html" redirecting to introduction.html.

I was wondering whether that would pose a problem, or whether there
might be a better way to redirect than using the meta tag / refresh
approach.

Thanks for looking into this. I probably didn?t make it clear that I am not questioning the errors on CRAN but my own configuration. I have pretty good idea where the error comes from, since the only change from the previous CRAN version was in medin.c (function medin_readf from line 94 and most probably line 144-145). I think also that all errors have medin.c on the trace.

It would be very helpful if somebody can spot from the description of my configuration in the original email where I have gone wrong in the setup of R with valgrind.

>realloc() does not initialize memory.  str.c contains a comment about replacing malloc() with calloc() to avoid?

            //    The data is not really left uninitialised and there may be a better way to let the compiler know.
            //
            s->data = (char *) calloc( size, sizeof( *(s->data) ) );
            if ( !s->data ) {
              error("Error.  Cannot allocate memory in str_initalloc, requested %lu characters.\n\n", size );
              // error("\n"); // error( EXIT_FAILURE );
            }
            s->data[0]='\0';
            s->dim=size;
            s->len=0;

My comment is indeed sloppy but the first byte is initialised to zero and the rest is used for writing only
(valgrind has no way to know, of course, and it is fair to question how a human can possibly be sure).


Thanks again,

realloc() does not initialize memory.  str.c contains a comment about replacing malloc() with calloc() to avoid similar problems that valgrind found.  It states that valgrind is mistaken, that that memory really is initialized.  Hmm.

I also see the error about reading off the end of a malloc'ed array:

However, running the checks with -use-valgrind  on my machine gives zero errors.
I am on Ubuntu (the latest stable version), my R-devel installation was updated earlier today and I rebuild it adding the
--with-valgrind-instrumentation=2 to the call to configure.
Valgrind coming with Ubuntu is 3.5.0, so I installed its latest version from  github (also no errors).

rbibutils has no dependencies, except that testthat is used for testing.

What am I missing? Do I need to have a separate library for the instrumented R-devel version?

As a side note, is there a way to find out if R has been built with valgrind? It seems that 'capabilities()' and 'R CMD config' do not offer this information.

Hi,

I recently submitted my package, which needs compilation of Rust code,
to CRAN. Now I'm seeing a CRAN check error on Solaris.

https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_string2path.html

Since Solaris is not a platform supported by Rust [1], I need to avoid
building on Solaris. I assumed specifying

    SystemRequirements: Cargo (rustc package manager)

would effectively achieve this, considering this seems the only common
thing among other CRAN packages [2][3] with Rust compilation. But, it
turned out I was wrong.

Are there any ways to ask CRAN to exclude Solaris?

Best,
Hiroaki Yutani

Dear all,

Are there any tools to edit .Rd files by hand (so avoiding roxygen2), as an editor (like could be *RdStudio*, ? la RStudio or TeXstudio) or a plugin for ViM or another editor (like could be *vim-Rd*, ? la vim-latex)?

Thanks for your answers,

Stay safe,
Iago

Yes, of course:
"All good" R package authors edit *.Rd files by hand
((;-), well no, I know it's not true ..
 I personally use roxygen (in ESS, see below) only sometimes at the very
 beginning of writing a new function, or for functions that I
 do *not* export, because there's a nice key stroke to create
 the outline). ... and if I export that function use the
 Roxygen -> Rd *once* only, and from then on, I edit the *.Rd nicely
 including using descriptions lists, some math, etc... all well
 indented, nicely human-readable etc, much nicer than hidden in
 roxygen R comments)

Rstudio has supported *.Rd in the past but as I'm not using it
regularly .. I don't know if they dropped it now... that would
honestly surprise me, though.

Rather  ESS (Emacs Speaks Statistics) has always well supported
Rd editing, and I thought the  vim - plugin for R would also
support *.Rd  but probably not ??

Best,
Martin

I always write mine by hand. Used to do it in notepad++. Now I just do it
as a text file in the Rstudio IDE.

Message-ID: <CA+emL6N19n0P+xBq+FjjUvcrg+c3xhSA0G7yiE4P-q7nBwurhA@mail.gmail.com>

I am in the final stages of preparing an R package
<https://github.com/cmt2/RevGadgets/tree/development> to submit to CRAN.
The package passes devtools::check() locally, GitHub Actions on multiple
systems (including windows), devtools::check_rhub() remotely, and
rhub::check_on_windows(check_args = "--force-multiarch"). However, it fails
on WinBuilder.

I'd appreciate any advice or suggestions. More details below:

You can see the full WinBuilder log here:
 https://win-builder.r-project.org/kTnuoY4Kqo8B/00check.log

We require the latest version of ggtree, a bioconductor package.
Unfortunately, this latest version is necessary for our package to
function. What's the best way to get access to that version of ggtree on
WinBuilder?

You can see the log for the successful rhub check_on_windows run here:

Thank you!

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Ongoing CXX17 woes
Message-ID: <CANnL8go2w=QtBdbLy3W-2b1H4Yr_xOdatRhJa6KH54FBbMPOmA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Folks,

I have a package that compiles fine under C++11 but it throws an "Error:
C++17 standard requested but CXX17 is not defined" error when checking
under Solaris.

My configure looks like:

#!/bin/sh

# Borrowed from
https://github.com/eddelbuettel/rcppsimdjson/blob/master/configure

: ${R_HOME=`R RHOME`}
if test -z "${R_HOME}"; then
    echo Could not determine R_HOME.
    exit 1
fi

CXX17=`${R_HOME}/bin/R CMD config --all | awk '{print $1}' | grep "^CXX17$"`

if test "x${CXX17}" = "x"; then
   sed -e 's/@CXXSTD@/CXX11/' -e 's/@NOCXX17@/-DNO_CXX17/' src/Makevars.in
> src/Makevars
else
   sed -e 's/@CXXSTD@/CXX17/' -e 's/@NOCXX17@//' src/Makevars.in >
src/Makevars
fi

exit 0

If I change the grep match to something nonsensical (forcing c++11), then
the package builds and checks just fine on my machine.

So it seems that there is some checking code that searches for c++17
statements in the package and throws an error. If that is the case, then
those checks should be removed as they cannot account for conditional
compilation. For example, in my vignettes, I have c++17 code but those
chunks are not evaluated if c++17 is not available.

Is the checking code available for inspection? I'd like to find exactly
where the error is coming from.

This seems to output "CXX17" on a machine with no C++17 support. On the
other hand, running `${R_HOME}/bin/R CMD config CXX17` here gives me an
empty string.

Not on my machine. But perhaps this is the issue with Solaris? You can
check the comments at
https://github.com/eddelbuettel/rcppsimdjson/blob/master/configure that
suggest the grep method is more robust. But perhaps that's no longer the
case or on all platforms.

Actually, you are right -- from the shell it does return a string. I'll try
the alternative version.

As configure is not run on windows, but according to the writing extensions
docs you can run commands in Makevars, is that not preferable for simple
cases?

What shell is active in Makevars? Is it "/bin/sh" or is make the
interpreter here?

Can we use $(shell ...cmd...) in Makevars on windows? I'm not sure where to
look for what syntax is in-play in the Makevars file during package
building other than trial-and-error.

If look closely enough at _Writing R Extensions_ you notice that it mentions
'configure.win' over half a dozen times.  A powerful trick is to then use the
fact that there are other packages on CRAN, in fact almost 18k of them.

And e.g. this search

  https://github.com/search?q=org%3Acran+configure.win&type=code

find 261 hits within the 'cran' mirror at GitHub for the term 'configure.win'.
Some of those are likely of use to you.

Snarky answers aside, it's still a valid question whether it's not just
cleaner in simple cases to run commands from the Makevars file as described
in the extensions doc. Of course there's no particularly useful examples
there and searching 'Makevars' on github (yes tried that) is not very
illuminating as it's too generic.

You can restrict your search to CRAN packages by using the 'cran' organization:
https://github.com/search?q=org%3Acran+filename%3AMakevars.win&type=Code

You can also have a `configure.win` file, that runs only on Windows, with sh.
Or you can have a single `configure` that works on all platforms, and
call that from `configure.win`. E.g.
https://github.com/cran/ps/blob/master/configure.win

I think the following change to str.c, in str_strcpy_internal(), fixes the
valgrind issues.  It was easier to track down after the calloc() was
changed to malloc(), since before it only happened after a realloc().

I don't know why valgrind isn't working for you.

IMHO it's ultimately up to you. Do what makes your life easier as a
package maintainer. If your package can be successfully configured
using only Makevars, then that's probably simplest. If Windows needs
special help, then it might be reasonable to have a separate
Makevars.win file. If you need to perform some extra introspection
about the user's machine, then you probably want a pair of configure
and configure.win scripts.

Since Makevars is just a Makefile, it is processed by make. Executed
shell commands then depend on what shell make has been configured to
use. That defaults to /bin/sh, but R installations might be configured
to use a different shell instead. If you look within $(R
RHOME)/etc/Makeconf you'll probably see something like:

    SHELL = /bin/sh

But that might differ on different platforms. (I don't immediately
recall how this is handled on Windows)

I don't quite understand your question re: "is make the interpreter
here?" -- make interprets Makefiles, which, while looking similar to
shell scripts, are their own thing. Recipes are effectively just
specially adorned shell commands, so while they are still interpreted
by make per-se, it does so by sending those commands to a shell for
execution. See https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/make.html
for the nitty gritty details.

I think you would have to consult with the CRAN maintainers to be sure
(assuming your question is whether CRAN would accept packages using
GNU extensions only on Windows). While the toolchain on Windows is
GNU-based and so GNU extensions are supported by the toolchain, it is
theoretically possible (although, to me, very unlikely) this could
change in the future.

Thanks. Just me trying to be minimalist and see if I could achieve the aim
without extra files, etc. All I need to do is see if the CXX17 config
option is empty and modify PKG_CPPFLAGS and CXX_STD appropriately. That
means calling R and and implementing an if-else in the Makevars file
outside of any make target (or that's my assumption). Searching how to do
that inevitably leads to 100's of GNU make examples using GNU extensions,
which are not portable across all R platforms and so are useless. (Thanks
for the link to the official non-extended make syntax.)

In the end, it was easier just to have a config and config.win as per
Dirk's suggestion.

Thanks Bill for taking the time to look into this, the patch, and the enlightening comments. 
 
I incorporated it and it resolved the valgrind issues. An old compiler issue resurfaced (Wstringop-truncation warning from strncopy) whose dodgy fix had introduced the current bug but it is now fixed.

As to valgrind, I adapted a Github actions workflow kindly provided by Martin R. Smith which reproduced the errors from CRAN.

I think the following change to str.c, in str_strcpy_internal(), fixes the valgrind issues.? It was easier to track down after the calloc() was changed to malloc(), since before it only happened after a realloc().

Thanks for looking into this. I probably didn?t make it clear that I am not questioning the errors on CRAN but my own configuration. I have pretty good idea where the error comes from, since the only change from the previous CRAN version was in medin.c (function medin_readf from line 94 and most probably line 144-145). I think also that all errors have medin.c on the trace.

It would be very helpful if somebody can spot from the description of my configuration in the original email where I have gone wrong in the setup of R with valgrind.

My comment is indeed sloppy but the first byte is initialised to zero and the rest is used for writing only

However, running the checks with -use-valgrind? on my machine gives zero errors.
I am on Ubuntu (the latest stable version), my R-devel installation was updated earlier today and I rebuild it adding the
--with-valgrind-instrumentation=2 to the call to configure.
Valgrind coming with Ubuntu is 3.5.0, so I installed its latest version from? github (also no errors).

rbibutils has no dependencies, except that testthat is used for testing.

What am I missing? Do I need to have a separate library for the instrumented R-devel version?

As a side note, is there a way to find out if R has been built with valgrind? It seems that 'capabilities()' and 'R CMD config' do not offer this information.

Thanks,

If it works on all other testing platforms, I'd just submit to CRAN and see if it works.
You may also just wait out until ggtree works on winbuilder...

I am in the final stages of preparing an R package
<https://github.com/cmt2/RevGadgets/tree/development> to submit to CRAN.
The package passes devtools::check() locally, GitHub Actions on multiple
systems (including windows), devtools::check_rhub() remotely, and
rhub::check_on_windows(check_args = "--force-multiarch"). However, it fails
on WinBuilder.

I'd appreciate any advice or suggestions. More details below:

We require the latest version of ggtree, a bioconductor package.
Unfortunately, this latest version is necessary for our package to

Dear CRAN maintainers,

I see there's a new WARN on the recently added macos-arm64 platform
for quite a number of packages. Specifically, vignette rebuilding
fails with "polygon edge not found" (example in [1]). In addition,
there are a number of warnings like this:

Warning in grid.Call(C_stringMetric, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label)) :
     no font could be found for family "Arial"

Is this something package authors should worry about in submissions?

Message-ID: <CAPcHnpS8EHAJ0ztwA_uEuBzSCi3TtmSdXz1Ak8+gCEwWMk61Hw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,


I've written two functions to emulate do while/until loops seen in other
languages, but I'm having trouble documenting its usage. The function is
typically used like:

do ({
    expr1
    expr2
    ...
}) %while% (cond)

so I want to document it something like:

do(expr) %while% (cond)
do(expr) %until% (cond)

to look like the documentation for 'while' and 'if', but R CMD check
produces a "Code/documentation mismatch" warning, complaining that the
documentation should look like:

expr %while% cond
expr %until% cond

So, my question is, is there a way to bypass the
* checking for code/documentation mismatches
portion of R CMD check, at least for one file? Some way to acknowledge that
the code and documentation will mismatch, but that's okay.


Thank you!

When not preceded by an expression wrapped in do(), %while% would throw an
error "do while loop must begin with 'do'". The function %while% looks like

`%while%` <- function (expr, cond)
invisible(.Call(C_do.while, substitute(expr), substitute(cond),
parent.frame()))

and the corresponding C function looks like

SEXP do_dowhile(SEXP expr, SEXP cond, SEXP rho)
{
    /* we're looking for an expression of the form
       do ( expr )
       do ( { expr1 ; expr2 } )

       there must NOT be a tag on the second item, the expression within
'do'
       that is, we reject expressions of the form

       do (var = expr)
       do (var = { expr1 ; expr2 } ) */
    if (TYPEOF(expr) != LANGSXP || CAR(expr) != install("do"))
        error("do while loop must begin with 'do'");
    else if (xlength(expr) != 2 || !isNull(TAG(CDR(expr))))
        error("invalid 'expr'");

The 'do' part of the expression is irrelevant and later removed, it's only
required because it makes the syntax look more like other languages.
So the proper way to use %while% is
expr %while% cond
where expr is wrapped with do(), but I think it would be far more
understandable in the usage documentation to have it look like
do(expr) %while% (cond)

If it helps at all with context, I'll provide the R and C scripts I'm using.

I understand that you did *not* ask .. but really
why don't you want to use R's own
builtin, fast, well documented, present everywhere *and* simpler syntax

while(cond) {
  expr1
  expr2
  ...
}	

???

and also

   repeat {
     expr1
     expr2
     ....
     if(cond) break
   }

instead of your   %until%  below?

I think the answer is no.  What I'd do is name the first argument to the 
operator in a way to indicate that it must be the result of do() and the 
second to indicate it must be parenthesized (if that's a 
requirement...), e.g.

`%while%` <- function(do_expr, parenthesized_cond) { ... }

and then document as

do_expr %while% parenthesized_cond

in the \usage section, and document standard usage in the \details 
section and examples.

Hello,


@Martin Maechler:
%until% and %while% use R's builtin repeat function. Something like

do(expr) %until% (cond)
repeat {
    expr
    if (cond)
        break
}

are identical. After %until% and %while% check the arguments look correct,
it makes a call to repeat like above and evaluates it in the same
environment as %until% or %while% was called from. I haven't completely
reinvented the wheel here.
%until% and %while% are slower than repeat, but only by a microsecond or
two.
Admittedly, my documentation for %until% and %while% is dog water compared
to repeat, but I've tried to make it as clear as possible in my
documentation that %until% and %while% use repeat,
and included the link to the documentation for repeat.


@Duncan Murdoch:
I'll try renaming the arguments, thank you for the suggestion. Also, I
didn't realize you could put R comments in \usage with #, so I might try
that as well, thank you!

   Wondering about etiquette/if I should start over again with a package 
submission. tl;dr, the package has been 'waiting' since 30 July (I 
responded the same day to the queries that were sent).

   For what it's worth, the 'pretest-waiting-recheck' message below was 
sent from *a* CRAN maintainer, but hitting "reply-all" in my mail client 
only included the "CRAN-submissions at -rproject.org" address. Maybe my 
mail client is misconfigured ? supposed to respond to the sender as well 
as the Reply-To: address? I could poke the individual CM who sent it 
personally, but I'm loath to do that unnecessarily ...

(Some previous history omitted here for brevity; there had been a bit of 
back-and-forth about this package previously.)

   07/30: Submitted version 1.1.2.2 of the glmmTMB package.  Got a 
"pretest-waiting-recheck" message asking us to confirm that we had 
addressed issues; I responded the same day.

   08/04, 08/06: Tried to confirm that the message was received (maybe I 
was too pushy?) -- no answer that I have seen.

   The CRAN queue in general seems to be moving OK 
(foghorn::cran_incoming(), 'archive' folder filtered out, sorted by 
time: 57 total, 45 from today or yesterday).

I'm also waiting several weeks for an update to be approved or sent back to
me.

In the meantime, the package has been archived by CRAN because the update
--- which fixes issues identified by CRAN --- hasn't been approved yet.

Message-ID: <5f6b7eae4db02d9eabb990520d3d5c27d90ae5ff.camel@unsw.edu.au>

Dear All,

TL;DR: Is there a way to get a full traceback and/or frame dump for
errors that occur in build-time and install-time \Sexpr{} calls in R
documentation files?


# Context

I am working on a package (
https://github.com/joycecheng/ergm/tree/ergm-term-index ) whose
documentation includes a number of \Sexpr[stage=render]{} calls, and I
am getting reports that some Windows users are not able to install the
package because they get errors when the HTML indices are being built.

Complicating the matter is that this only seems to affect some Windows
systems but not others.

Unfortunately, R's output is not very helpful in identifying the
problem beyond the help file in which it had occurred and the terminal
error message. For example, on those systems with R 4.1.0:

remotes::install_github("joycecheng/ergm at ergm-term-index")

gives (for those users):

[SNIP]

E> * removing

E> -----------------------------------
E> ERROR: package installation failed


# What I've tried so far

 * Running the code in the \Sexpr{} manually in an R session doesn't
   reproduce the error: this seems to be a build/install-time issue.
 * options(error=...) does the wrong thing, because the \Sexpr{} code
   is run inside tryCatch(), so what gets traced and/or dumped is
   catching code, not the original error.

Thanks in advance,
Pavel

It may be worth checking if the users can install the package if you send them (1) tarball or (2) a binary build (if you don't have Windows, win-builder creates one).

(Sorry for the previous messages, accidentally sent it prematurely while typing on the phone.)

It may be worth checking if the users can install the package if you send them (1) tarball or (2) a binary build (if you don't have Windows, win-builder creates one). A user had a similar issue with a package of mine and (1) didn't work but (2) did. On my Windows laptop I had  similar issue and resolved it by updating the packages in the current  installation. 
The reason for the problem seemed to be inconsistent versions of some installed packages, almost certainly Matrix and matrixStats in my case.

I'm not certain this will give you enough debug information, but you can 
run R CMD build in the current session using the internal function 
tools::.build_packages, e.g.

   R CMD build --no-manual testpkg

would be run as

   tools:::.build_packages(c("--no-manual", "testpkg"))

This removes one level of processes, but the tryCatch() and processes 
run within this function are still there, so it might not be sufficient 
for you.  In that case the only solution might be to add debugging code 
into R and recompile it.

The similar command for INSTALL is tools:::.install_packages.

Message-ID: <946F6873-4056-4AF6-9602-665CDE0E01B3@precisionmethods.guru>

Whereas Unicode U+00d7 (times), U+00b1 (plus-minus) and U+03bc (mu) have equivalents in Latin-1 encoding, and I have used these without difficulty in strings, neither U+2206 (INCREMENT) nor U+0394 (Greek Delta) does:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1
Consequently, my attempt to use a parameter named '\u2206t' as in the following

generates the following WARNING on Windows R-CMD-check:

> checking R files for syntax errors ... WARNING
  Warning in file 'R/cpe.R':

From this article by Tomas Kalibera
https://developer.r-project.org/Blog/public/2020/05/02/utf-8-support-on-windows/,
I gather that quite often problems such as these won't actually bubble up to the user experience.
Is this one such case? Or would this WARNING be fatal to a CRAN submission?

But not in some other locale encodings on Windows (e.g. CP-1251), nor
in some single-byte locale encodings on *nix-like systems (e.g.
ru_RU.KOI8-R), which are admittedly used much rarer nowadays than on
Windows. Unless I'm mistaken, the "\u2206t" in your example needs to
become a symbol, and symbols are always translated into the locale
encoding [1] [2].

I would expect this warning to be a problem for CRAN, but I'm just
another package developer, so I could be wrong.

Yes, this is a problem. Only ASCII characters should be used in symbol 
names (in R packages), as they can be represented in every (supported) 
locale.

Some characters would be best-fitted by Windows (replaced by other 
similar characters) during translation to native encoding, if they are 
not representable directly, but that can produce surprising results and 
should not be relied on, definitely not in packages.

Hi all,

PFA the pre-check results for my package surfaltr from CRAN. I am having troubles with a package dependency on Debian that I am not able to fix. 2 functions in my package require a Bioconductor package msa (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/msa.html). To deal with this error, I tried the following solution of adding a call to BiocManager and also including a code for msa installation but it did not help:

#' @importFrom BiocManager install
#' @import msa
.
.
.
Foo() {
if (!requireNamespace("msa", quietly = TRUE)){
    BiocManager::install("msa")}
}

How do I solve the problem so that I don't generate this error with Debian?

Thank you,
Pooja

Packages on CRAN can depend on released packages from both CRAN and 
Bioconductor.

I don't know why "msa" is missing on the Debian check machine. The check 
results of another CRAN package that suggests "msa" indicate that this 
package is currently unavailable on all Linux, Solaris and macOS 
machines of the CRAN check farm: 
https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_bio3d.html

Maybe this is a temporary problem? You could try resubmitting in a few days.

I think you should remove the automatic package installation from your 
functions; they should not write to the user's home filespace without 
consent.
You should probably also avoid this NOTE when submitting to CRAN:

 > Version contains large components (1.0.0.9000)

EXTERNAL EMAIL: Use caution before replying, clicking links, and opening attachments.

Packages on CRAN can depend on released packages from both CRAN and Bioconductor.

I don't know why "msa" is missing on the Debian check machine. The check results of another CRAN package that suggests "msa" indicate that this package is currently unavailable on all Linux, Solaris and macOS machines of the CRAN check farm: 
https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_bio3d.html

Maybe this is a temporary problem? You could try resubmitting in a few days.

I think you should remove the automatic package installation from your functions; they should not write to the user's home filespace without consent.
You should probably also avoid this NOTE when submitting to CRAN:

 > Version contains large components (1.0.0.9000)

Best regards,

Dear Berry,

Thanks for your reply! I was away from my computer until now. We also
submitted to CRAN, but the dependency version is still causing an error:

The ERROR referenced is the same ggtree version error, and the Note is
simply that this is a first time CRAN submission. Is there any way that a
bioconductor package could be manually installed on WinBuilder? If so,
perhaps we could ask the dependency's maintainer to help us out and upload
the new version themselves. Other ideas would be very welcome --- we have a
deadline for getting the package on CRAN so waiting for the dependency to
be updated is not an ideal solution for us!

Thanks again for your help and suggestions!
Carrie

Hi,

submitting an update of our package ordPens failed (update version is 1.0.0), reporting the following:
Version: 1.0.0
ok
Version: 0.3-1

But these are exactly the new changes that we already took care of in the updated version 1.0.0
The previous version 0.3-1 is from 2015 and due to R updates, the old package won?t work any more. 
That is exactly the reason for update version 1.0.0, were everything is fixed now.

Also,
- there is a NOTE about change in maintainer, which is already stated in the cran-comments.md, and the previous maintainer sent an e-main to CRAN as well
- there is a NOTE saying 'Examples with CPU (user + system) or elapsed time > 10s?
which is also stated in the cran-comments.md explaining that cross-validation examples are important for illustrating the package usage.
 

So is this a false positive?

When the previous version has problems, you get an email listing them, followed with something like 'Did you fix them? Please Reply-All...'

Maybe you missed the last phrase?

Please fix all problems and resubmit a fixed version via the webform. 
If you are fairly certain the rejection is a false positive, please reply-all to this message and explain.

I really don?t understand how else to fix (and what to fix). These are out of date problems of version 0.3-1, which are not relevant any more in version 1.0.0
Version 1.0.0 exactly was a fix to those. 

Do you think I can reply-all & explain that this must be a false-positive?

Hi Pooja,

In the code below, you install msa if it's missing. This is considered bad practice, as it installs a new package without explicitly asking for the user's permission. I'm surprised it wasn't flagged by the CRAN checks.

Make sure msa is in the "Imports" field of your DESCRIPTION file, and you should be fine. As Sebastian mentioned, it's possible the error you saw is transient, as Bioconductor packages are typically available for testing on CRAN machines.

Best,

********************************************************

Hi all,

PFA the pre-check results for my package surfaltr from CRAN. I am having troubles with a package dependency on Debian that I am not able to fix. 2 functions in my package require a Bioconductor package msa (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/msa.html). To deal with this error, I tried the following solution of adding a call to BiocManager and also including a code for msa installation but it did not help:

#' @importFrom BiocManager install
#' @import msa
.
.
.
Foo() {
if (!requireNamespace("msa", quietly = TRUE)){
    BiocManager::install("msa")}
}

How do I solve the problem so that I don't generate this error with Debian?

Thank you,
Pooja

If my submission is no longer visible using foghorn::cran_incoming(), that
means it has expired and I should resubmit, right?

What is the proper way to indicate that a package submitted to CRAN
requires the gcc compiler on Solaris? I haven't been able to find any
information about how to indicate that in a way that the CRAN builders will
pick up on it.

No direct experience, so others may know more, but I'd have thought in the system requirements of DESCRIPTION. See for instance what duckdb does https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/blob/master/tools/rpkg/DESCRIPTION

   I think you're stuck with what you get as far as compilers go (see 
below), but it shouldn't be a deal-breaker for CRAN.

The list of CRAN test platforms 
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_flavors.html> indicates 
that the platform uses the Oracle Developer Studio 12.6 compiler , but 
the DETAILS 
<https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/Rconfig/r-patched-solaris-x86> say 
"GCC is used for packages linking to Rcpp|cpp11|StanHeaders, rgdal/sf 
(GDAL is only compilable with g++) and about 40 others."

   So if you link to one of those packages or the undisclosed 40 others, 
you will get GCC (details below).  If not, or if you're not sure, you 
should indicate in your submission message that your package only works 
with GCC on Solaris. According to the CRAN policies 
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html>

Package authors should make all reasonable efforts to provide 
cross-platform portable code. Packages will not normally be accepted 
that do not run on at least two of the major R platforms. [I believe 
"the major R platforms" means {MacOS, Windows, Linux} but I don't think? 
this is explicitly defined anywhere.]

   So, at least as far as publicly viewable policies go, the CRAN 
maintainers would be able to ask you to make "all reasonable efforts". 
(In my opinion, figuring out how to make your package work properly with 
ODS 12.6 would take more than a "reasonable" effort, but .. ???)

   cheers
    Ben Bolker

Hi,

I submitted a package to CRAN, but it keeps failing a particular check for
Windows. This error shows up when I check my code examples.

Error: connections left open:
>         <-CRANwin.fb05.statistik.uni-dortmund.de:11602

> Execution halted


For context, my code example does the following.

suppressWarnings(require(doParallel))
> registerDoParallel(cores = 2)
>


# Some code examples that use foreach and %dopar%



stopImplicitCluster()


Other contextual information:

   - I already import doParallel in the DESCRIPTION file.
   - My package passes all checks on the Linux machine.

I have read elsewhere (e.g., this thread
<https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future/issues/327>) that examples with
parallelization lead to this error. However stopImplicitCluster() does not
seem to fix it.

Could someone familiar with this please troubleshoot? Thank you.

Alan

While we generally get an email about these things, CRAN appears to have
closed shop for a week to take a well deserved break until September 1.

Or so the message says---the hourly CRANberriesFeed cron job saw packages
being processed, but that too is not uncommon when the queues get cleared.

To all not yet back to fall term teaching: enjoy a few more days of summer.

No idea about the doParallel package, but perhaps it helps to open a 
cluster explicitly and in the end stop exactly that cluster?

As per Dr. Ligges, I?ve had more success closing the named cluster than
using stopImplicit.

Message-ID: <CAMyz+tXh9LGAA=MuLGmCCg_tXMn-9vC0EFgbT1DUgnoFbiE0nw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,
I have a package called pliman <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=pliman>
which depends on the Bioconductor package EBImage.

When running install.packages("pliman") I get the following warning

Warning in install.packages :  dependency ?EBImage? is not available

and thus when loading the package with library(pliman), the following error
occurs

Erro: package or namespace load failed for ?pliman? in loadNamespace(i,
c(lib.loc, .libPaths()), versionCheck = vI[[i]]):
 there is no package called ?EBImage?

I created a check function to check if EBImage is available and if not, ask
users if they want to install it

---
check_ebi <- function(){
  if(!requireNamespace("EBImage", quietly = TRUE)) {
    inst <-
    switch(menu(c("Yes", "No"), title = "Package {EBImage} required but not
available.\nDo you want to install it now?"),
           "yes", "no")
    if(inst == "yes"){
      if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)){
        install.packages("BiocManager")
      }
      BiocManager::install("EBImage", ask = FALSE, update = FALSE)
    } else{
      message("To use {pliman}, first install {EBImage} with
'BiocManager::install(\"EBImage\")'.")
    }
  }
}
---

Is there any way to run this function prior to namespace loading? I tried
putting check_ebi() into .onLoad() but the same error occurs.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions.
Tiago

People shouldn't be able to install your package unless the "hard" 
dependencies are available.

If EBImage isn't essential to your package, you should make it a "soft" 
dependency by listing it in Suggests and checking for it every time you 
use it.

Two more comments.

1. Note that your code only works in interactice mode, not when checking 
your package as it waits infinitely for the user's choice.

2. I do not see an advantage of installing BiocManager if EBImage is 
needed, the essential part is simply to select BioC as a repository to 
install packages from.

Best,
Uwe Ligges

Thank you, Duncan and Uwe for the suggestions.
 I followed your instructions and created a function to check for EBImage
that is only called in an interactive section and, if necessary, ask the
user to install the package with install.packages("EBImage", repos="
https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.13/bioc")

Best,
Tiago

Message-ID: <29D22DE2-AD4D-421A-ADCA-9ED2A61E1B6B@krugs.de>

Hi

I submitted an update of the dmdScheme package and got the response back from the pre-submission check that it failed on one platform with the Note:

* checking for non-standard things in the check directory ... NOTE
Found the following files/directories:
  ?emeScheme?

(Links to the logs are here:

package dmdScheme_1.2.7.tar.gz does not pass the incoming checks automatically, please see the following pre-tests:
Windows: <https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/dmdScheme_1.2.7_20210901_161445/Windows/00check.log>
Status: OK
Debian: <https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/dmdScheme_1.2.7_20210901_161445/Debian/00check.log>
Status: 1 NOTE

)

This only occurs on the CRAN server and I can not reproduce it with rhub or locally on my Mac with 4.1.1.

I can currently not check the level version, as it seems to be not compiling for Mac. 

Could somebody give any guidance, how to fix this? Which one is the ?check directory"? 

Thanks,

Rainer

That's the one reported at the start of the log as the "log directory".

Fixing it is a little harder without more info.  That looks like a name 
that you would have created, given the name of your package.  You should 
look at your package source to figure out if there's an example or test 
that created it but didn't delete it.

I will look at it and come back when I have further questions.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Unicode Name Warnings for Package Constant
Message-ID: <06b101d7a00e$99b792d0$cd26b870$@denney.ws>

Hello,

 

In the janitor package, we want to optionally support conversion from
Unicode characters that visually map to mu or micro to the character "u".
For that, we were thinking to create an unexported character vector constant
with names of all the Unicode mu/micro characters and values of "u".  As a
work-around, I was able to fix the issue using setNames(), but it was a
non-intuitive fix, and I would prefer to just use create the named character
vector directly.

 

Is there a good way to prevent the warnings below?

 

When running the following (on Windows 10 with R 4.1.0) either during a
normal R session or while checking the package (via devtools::check()), we
get several warnings:

 

mu_to_u <-

I think the warning comes because on non-UTF8 platforms there are 
operations that will mess up names.  So using setNames() may fool the 
check, but it probably won't solve the problem.

On the other hand, I think all current platforms handle UTF8 data fine, 
so keeping the vector of characters as data should be fine.  Then the 
base chartr() function could do your translation for you.

To do the translation you want, you'd use something like

   original <- "45 \u00b5m"
 
chartr("\u00b5\u03bc\u3382\u338c\u338d\u3395\u339b\u33b2\u33b6\u33bc", 
"uuuuuuuuuu", original)

In the current R releases, R symbol names are in the native encoding, 
which on Windows in R (the normal MSVCRT builds up to R 4.1) cannot be 
UTF-8 nor any other Unicode encoding. So you can't portably use such 
characters e.g. in names of vector elements or of bindings in an 
environment, so not even as keys in a hash map implemented using an 
environment.

This works in UCRT builds of Windows on recent Windows 10 (and on Unix 
and macOS for many years), but before that becomes the norm, it might be 
easiest to give up on this feature in your package. But, in principle, 
you can work with UTF-8 strings, sometimes (one needs to check the 
docs), but they cannot be R symbols. So you can do some operations e.g. 
with a vector like

c(mu = "\u00b5")

where the UTF-8 string is a value, not a name.

Best
Tomas

Dear All,

I'm trying to submit an R package to CRAN and there is a new warning that
did not use to appear a few days ago when checking with winbuilder (R under
development version):

Found the following significant warnings:
  Warning: 'memory.limit()' is no longer supported
See 'd:/RCompile/CRANincoming/R-devel/masscor.Rcheck/00install.out' for details.

Package build is attached and Check results when the warning did not
appear are at: https://win-builder.r-project.org/2zQe5ZnEci31/

I would appreciate if someone could please provide me with some guide
on how to solve this issue.

Thanks in advance.

Sincerely,

Cristhian Paredes

The specific repository you've chosen is not what you want to do. This will always install EBImage from Bioconductor version 3.13, but Bioconductor version 3.13 is only relevant for R-4.1 (see https://bioconductor.org/about/release-announcements/)

Personally, I would encourage you to follow the Bioconductor community best practice of BiocManager::install("EBImage"). In that way you will get the version of EBImage that has been tested with other Bioconductor packages in the same release, and on the version of R in use by your user.

If you were to use a specific repository, it should the one that is as good as base R can do (this can be different from the version that BiocManager would choose because R's release cycle is different from Bioconductor's). I think this is most easily accomplished by utils::chooseBioCmirror(), and then selecting the 0-Bioconductor repository. That's a lot to tell your users... Maybe others in the R community have a better way (the key information is in tools:::.BioC_version_associated_with_R_version(), but that is not an exported function so not recommended for CRAN packages...)

There was a recent changed made to R to remove that option.
There is documentation visible in the patch that explains it:

https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/commit/795fb3fe60d35734750afbc34cc7d36b19290b9c

Presumably you would have to remove any uses of the now
unsupported functions.? After the patch, the only thing those
functions do is issue the warning.

Or you might need to make their use conditional on the R
version.? It is possible that the call is still needed if your
package is run on older versions of R.? I am not familiar with
the general use of this though.? I only noticed the change
in R-devel and linked it to your question.

Best,

B.

Message-ID: <CAOxgwDADpXOjzAA7wH2RqWqVRcF-vA0iubstSkhNynQtbJfFyg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All:

I submitted a package to CRAN. I developed it in DEBIAN and tested it in
R-HUB windows devel, windows release, and macOS. None of the systems throw
an
error to me, and I mainly get notes about the package archived condition.

However, the package failed at win-builder devel, as in one of the tests I
call
base::system.file to read a file and the function --only there-- returns
the file
path twice.

Does system.file work differently on windows?

You can check out CRAN win-builder check.log at:

Dear Brodie Gaslam,

Thank you for your quick reply.
Do you maybe know how could I avoid the use of  'memory.limit()' during

Cristhian Paredes

Thanks for your response Martin,
I'm definitely thinking to use BiocManager::install("EBImage") since it is
the official suggestion of the Bioconductor community. Anyway, I've been
learning a lot from this discussion. Thanks all!!
Best,
Tiago

Dear Cristhian,

memory.limit() is called by package "ff" when it is loaded. Your new 
package uses "ff" via "propagate". Perhaps the easiest option for you is 
to re-try the submission once "ff" is adapted to this change in R-devel.

Best
Tomas

Dear Tomas Kalibera,

Thank you so much for the information.
I'll use an alternative package to 'propagate' ('metRology') hoping the
warning will disappear.

Thanks to all the community for their time.
Best regards.
Cristhian

Actually, I think the right thing to do is to tell the user what to do ("To use this feature, install EBImage following the directions at https://bioconductor.org/packages/EBImage') instead of doing it for them.

Thanks for your response?Martin,
I'm definitely?thinking to use?BiocManager::install("EBImage") since it is the official suggestion of the Bioconductor community. Anyway, I've been learning a lot from this discussion. Thanks all!!
Best,
Tiago

The specific repository you've chosen is not what you want to do. This will always install EBImage from Bioconductor version 3.13, but Bioconductor version 3.13 is only relevant for R-4.1 (see https://bioconductor.org/about/release-announcements/)

Personally, I would encourage you to follow the Bioconductor community best practice of BiocManager::install("EBImage"). In that way you will get the version of EBImage that has been tested with other Bioconductor packages in the same release, and on the version of R in use by your user.

If you were to use a specific repository, it should the one that is as good as base R can do (this can be different from the version that BiocManager would choose because R's release cycle is different from Bioconductor's). I think this is most easily accomplished by utils::chooseBioCmirror(), and then selecting the 0-Bioconductor repository. That's a lot to tell your users... Maybe others in the R community have a better way (the key information is in tools:::.BioC_version_associated_with_R_version(), but that is not an exported function so not recommended for CRAN packages...)

Fabio,

Judging from prior versions of your package, the function `tile_read`
makes many assumptions as to what paths will look like, and also
modifies paths.? In this case, it appears to be thrown off by either
the lower case drive name, or the forward slashes in the path.? Presumably
winbuilder is now running in a configuration that does different things
with paths.

Under those new paths, your code will double up the path by pre-pending
the current working directory.? This is not a `system.file` issue.

I just took the second part of (grabbed from the error message):

'd:/RCompile/CRANincoming/R-devel/uFTIR.Rcheck/d:/RCompile/CRANincoming/R-devel/lib/uFTIR/extdata/tile.bsp'

and fed it to your function from the prior version of your package
and was able to produce a doubled up path as above.

Best,

B.

PS: with this type of thing it is always helpful if you can provide a
link to an online repository with the version of the code that you
are trying to submit.

Dear All:

I submitted a package to CRAN. I developed it in DEBIAN and tested it in
R-HUB windows devel, windows release, and macOS. None of the systems throw
an
error to me, and I mainly get notes about the package archived condition.

However, the package failed at win-builder devel, as in one of the tests I
call
base::system.file to read a file and the function --only there-- returns
the file
path twice.

Does system.file work differently on windows?

You can check out CRAN win-builder check.log at:

Message-ID: <CADbDLZ=mer=LQQ23ki+CGWvxMYR=CgKnQWVRDufaxpydQGPoaw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

Sorry if this is the wrong mailing address.

I was doing a little investigation of R versions in packages and
discovered a number of errors:

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bartCause/index.html  - R (? 3.1-0)
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/activityGCMM/index.html  - R (3.00)
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/deTestSet/index.html - R (? 2.01)

and also

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/NGSSEML/ - R (? 1.9.0), R (?
3.5.0), R (? 3.5.0), R (? 3.5.0), R (? 3.5.0), R (? 3.5.0), R (?
3.5.0)

Overall I detected ~40 packages with issues:

c("activityGCMM", "behavr", "bioassays", "bvpSolve", "celestial",
"chest", "CRTSize", "csppData", "damr", "deTestSet", "diagram",
"directPA", "DiscreteFDR", "ecolMod", "ecp", "epibasix", "europepmc",
"fabisearch", "FDX", "ggetho", "hyper.fit", "MedSurvey", "NBPSeq",
"NetIndices", "NFWdist", "OmegaG", "primer", "RATest", "refund",
"RmarineHeatWaves", "rmcfs", "rootSolve", "RPPASPACE", "scopr",
"scoringRules", "seqDesign", "shape", "sleepr", "SMPracticals",
"text", "tggd", "zeitgebr")

It seems like this would be a useful check to implement on the R CMD check.

Thanks

Colin

----

I am lost with what they mean by "Check: for non-standard things in the check directory, Result: NOTE  Found the following files/directories:  'ggOceanMapsData'".

The package requires ggOceanMapsData package to function. That package is too large for CRAN and has been placed in a drat repository on Github. I have used install.packages() in the vignette ( https://github.com/MikkoVihtakari/ggOceanMaps/blob/3c3d4daa5a26b262db569a3465208face0fca731/vignettes/ggOceanMaps.Rmd#L17) to make it possible to compile the vignette. Could it be that the check on Debian has begun to pick on this line for some reason? As said, I have not encountered this issue before, and the package was on CRAN before being pulled by another problem.

Any insight would be appreciated.

All the best,

Exactly what errors do you think you found? It is not an error for a package to be compatible with a range of versions of R.

I suspect that the author didn't mean to specify 7 versions of R
(https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/NGSSEML/) under Depends.

When a package specifies R >= 2.01 did they mean R 2.0.1 or R 2.1.0
(https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/diagram/)

Or specifying R >= 2.16 (which doesn't exist) -
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/seqDesign/

I realise that the above aren't "errors", but they do strongly
indicate that the package author is making a mistake.

Thanks

Colin

I suspect so, too, but it works.

Yes, this is not obvious. But then it will be interpreted as R >= 2.1 
which is not wrong in any case (even if 2.0.1 was meant).


> Or specifying R >= 2.16 (which doesn't exist) -

Actually R-2.16.0 did exist as a development version that was later on 
renumbered to 3.0.0, so it is right.

The only unclear statement is the 2.01, but compareVersion() does a 
sensible thing. So I do not worry too much.

Message-ID: <CALG31BVjOWF8xkX3L5M5oKqrsOTwJXQ=ZpceAsK5z4J_8eu=6Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello list,

my package 'slga' has been flagged for potential removal from CRAN
because of the following:

> Please see the problems shown on
> <https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_slga.html>.

> Please correct before 2021-09-19 to safely retain your package on CRAN.

> This needs correction whether or not the resource recovers.

The issue is that the WCS server from which the package retrieves data
sometimes gets overloaded, and throws a 502 error. I currently use a
stop(message)) to return the http error code to the user, e.g. here -
https://github.com/obrl-soil/slga/blob/a770dac9f101995db92e2d42476af8705971d80c/R/get_data.R#L61

I just want to clarify whether the problem is an overly brief error
message, or my use of stop() in this context? What is the preferred
pattern for handling these kinds of errors?

Many thanks,
Lauren O'Brien

Exit gracefully, i.e. without an ERROR.

I think it's neither: it's perfectly fine to use the R error system to
signal being unable to establish function postconditions, but then the
tests shouldn't fail because of that (yes, including the \donttest{}
ones).

So, in my opinion, both stop() and the error message are okay, but the
example should wrap them in try() / tryCatch() and check the return
value correctly.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] S3 is.unsorted registration
Message-ID: <CAJmOi+OVct_urMCT44XLuKywhn6hMkzGtxrs_kjWUO6gHwMvcA@mail.gmail.com>

I would like to register an S3 method for `is.unsorted` for my
package's class "factor256" but I'm having trouble honouring the
`strictly` argument.  I've defined

is.unsorted.factor256 <- function(x, na.rm = FALSE, strictly = FALSE) {
  strictly
}

i.e. the class is sorted iff strictly = TRUE

However, the strictly argument appears to be ignored

x <- integer(2)
class(x) <- "factor256"

is.unsorted(x)  # FALSE [expected]
is.unsorted(x, strictly = TRUE)  # FALSE [unexpected]

The method is definitely being dispatched as when I change the function to

is.unsorted.factor256 <- function(x, na.rm = FALSE, strictly = FALSE) {
  cat("dispatching\n")
  strictly
}

I see the dispatch:

is.unsorted(ff, strictly = T)
#> dispatching
#> [1] FALSE

and

> methods("is.unsorted")
[1] is.unsorted.factor256
see '?methods' for accessing help and source code

I note that if I omit the na.rm = argument I will get the intended
result (I was drawn to the solution by noting the .Internal call has
omitted it) but I'm wondering whether this is correct.

Hugh Parsonage.

Moreover, if I define

is.unsorted.factor256 <- function(x, na.rm = FALSE, strictly = FALSE) {
 ?? cat("dispatching\n")
 ?? print(match.call())
 ?? strictly
}

I get:

is.unsorted(ff, strictly = T)


# dispatching
# is.unsorted.factor256(x = x, na.rm = strictly)
# [1] FALSE

While defining not a method but a classic function works as expected:

f=function(x, na.rm = FALSE, strictly = FALSE) {
 ?? cat("f\n")
 ?? print(match.call())
 ?? strictly
}

f(ff, strictly=T)

# f
# f(x = ff, strictly = T)
# [1] TRUE

Just my 0.02 ?

Hello,

I received the following output from my package, oncoPredict.

However, I don't understand how to correct this error. I've tested the
advice here:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14358814/error-in-r-cmd-check-packages-required-but-not-available
without success.

Any thoughts as to how this error can be fixed?

Reminder that you have to re-install any packages that your oncoPredict package depends on for the new R version 4.1.1.  Packages are downloaded/installed to a specific R version.  If you switch to another version, everything needs to be reinstalled.  I always get this error after upgrading or switching R versions.

 ?

If you?ve already reinstalled and are still getting the error, then maybe it is something with your NAMESPACE or DESCRIPTION file.  Like if you are using a package inside a function, but forget to add it to the DESCRIPTION.  Or you put it in the DESCRIPTION, but forget to add the @import roxygen directive above your function so that it gets into the NAMESPACE.  

 ?

Those are the situations that most commonly generate this error, from what I have seen.

Hello,

I received the following output from my package, oncoPredict.

However, I don't understand how to correct this error. I've tested the advice here:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14358814/error-in-r-cmd-check-packages-required-but-not-available
without success.

Any thoughts as to how this error can be fixed?

This advice would apply if the errors were being generated on a computer under the package developer's control... but this looks like it is from a repo submission.

That said, if the developer has installed packages not currently in BioC for R4.1.1 they may need to wait for those packages to propagate in the official BioC repo and then to the submission test computers.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] 'rlang' win-builder error for package without rlang
 dependency
Message-ID: <CAM2gKPZadzf8jJt=h006E4buJYWBZ0sON2fWBtbUU-5kdVnwWg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

My recent CRAN package submission failed with a win-builder error during
the tests and vignette building *of the previously submitted version* [1]:

```
    Error in library.dynam(lib, package, package.lib) :
      DLL 'rlang' not found: maybe not installed for this architecture?
```

(The log also shows another testing error with the new version which I can
make neither heads nor tails of, but that?s a separate issue.)

My package does not directly depend on 'rlang' (though it is a transitive
'Suggests' (build time) dependency via 'testthat'). I?m at a loss how to
fix this issue. The closest I could find was [2], where the error is caused
by tests being run for a mismatching architecture. In my case, the error
seems to be caused by 'testthat' not being able to load the rlang DLL for
x64 (weirdly the tests run to completion for the [mismatching] i386
architecture). Given that I don?t control (a) which architecture is tested
on win-builder, nor (b) how 'testthat' loads its dependencies, how can I
fix this?

? or was this error included in the win-builder output of the new
submission as a simple FYI and can be safely ignored?

Hi Konrad,

This happened to me too on Thursday. I tried retesting on Friday and ran
into the same problem with a different function (vctrs instead of rlang).
But Friday night when I retested, the problem had resolved itself. Curious
to hear what could have happened, but I'd also suggest retesting now if if
you haven't tried again since.

Cheers,
Carrie

Hi Carrie,

Thanks for the prompt reply, good to hear that I?m not the only one
experiencing this (the fact that this hadn?t been posted to r-package-devel
yet had dispirited me).

I?ll try resubmitting as soon as I?ve taken care of the other (real) issues.

Yes, the current CRAN status of the package is appended just FYI / for 
comparison.

These appended check results in the Debian pre-test output regularly 
confuse package developers. I am suggesting (to R-core) to simply add 
more empty lines before "current CRAN status" and maybe it should also 
say something like "(for comparison)" to clarify that these results are 
not the reason for the failure of the automatic pretest.

Best regards,

Sebastian:  R-core isn't involved in this.  CRAN is a separate group.

Message-ID: <40eb08bb-53b6-fb89-e2c6-3562b09fb17f@gmail.com>

   I may have asked something like this before, but ...

The glmmTMB package is currently segfaulting (on the very first example) 
on its CRAN Solaris checks
https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-patched-solaris-x86/glmmTMB-00check.html

----

  *** caught segfault ***
address 4539ec45, cause 'memory not mapped'
---



  We have to submit a new version to CRAN soon; we will most likely beg 
the CRAN maintainers' indulgence for having it fail on Solaris, but it 
would be nice to fix it if we can.

    The CRAN Solaris platform is 64-bit x86_64, using gcc/g++ because 
the package uses Rcpp.

   The package builds/checks fine on the r-hub `solaris-x86-patched` 
platform, which is identical as far as I can tell **except** 32-bit 
rather than 64-bit.

   Short of installing 64-bit Solaris in a VM (which I have not done yet 
because of random compatibility/command-line bullshittery that put me 
off), does anyone have any wisdom to share for diagnosing and/or 
guessing what the problem is?

   Here are some links to similar errors, none of them seem terribly 
useful/relevant.

https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-patched-solaris-x86/prt-00check.html

   glmmTMB is built on a pretty big stack (Eigen, Rcpp, RcppEigen, 
CppAD, TMB) - the problem could be somewhere in there (the TMB package 
runs no tests and very few examples on CRAN, so there could be problems 
there that only get flagged when we try glmmTMB examples).

if anyone is interested.

Hi Ben,

According to https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/Rconfig/r-patched-solaris-x86
CRAN's Solaris is also 32 bit.
But maybe I am missing something?

You can download a Solaris VM (for Virtualbox or VMware) from
https://files.r-hub.io/solaris/
It has both 32 bit and 64 bit R (with gcc) and ODS R as well. You can
update R on it like this:
https://github.com/r-hub/solarischeck/tree/master/packer#updating-r

Best,
Gabor

Message-ID: <DB7PR01MB437815857FA9BEB5A5CEA517B9DB9@DB7PR01MB4378.eurprd01.prod.exchangelabs.com>

Hi,

My statgenHTP package is failing the CRAN check for r-release-macos-arm64 only, see https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_statgenHTP.html

The issue should be easy to fix, the tested function is just a few lines of code. However I have no idea how to replicate the problem. I tried the 3 macOS platforms available on rhub, but the tests pass there without a problem.
I don't have access to a mac myself. Could anyone point me in the right direction of how I could replicate my problem?

Thanks,
Bart-Jan van Rossum

  I think I got confused by the fact that the second line of

https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/Rconfig/r-patched-solaris-x86
is "Solaris 10 on ix64/x64".

   I interpreted that as "64-bit Solaris".  On the other hand the rest 
of the information in that file says that the default ODS compiler used 
is a 32-bit build; it doesn't say anything about the build of the 
alternative gcc compiler (which is used for packages with Rcpp etc.) 
Other comments farther down in the file (about versions of Java, 
protobuf used) do suggest that the system is indeed 32-bit.

  If the CRAN Solaris platform is indeed 32-bit, then I really have no 
idea why checks are failing on CRAN but succeeding on r-hub (but I also 
feel better about not trying to fix it ...)

   I do appreciate the provision of the resources for setting up a 
virtual Solaris box - I don't recall exactly what hurdle I encountered 
last time I tried, it was probably some weird idiosyncratic thing.

   For the record I haven't tried valgrind recently, but the CRAN 
versions of the valgrind tests weren't throwing any errors ...

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] IFC package - Solaris error polygon edge not found
 (zero-width or zero-height?)
Message-ID: <CAGf8esj=3gp2v8dggH7Zh_UTBv7k62dqM6G0QuFgsMYj+u4aJA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello community,

I plan to submit a new version of IFC package to CRAN.

I checked it locally, on win-builder and on rhub. Almost everything looks
OK except for:
- Debian Linux, R-devel, GCC ASAN/UBSAN
- Oracle Solaris 10, x86, 32 bit, R-release

On Debian Linux, R-devel, GCC ASAN/UBSAN, I get a PREPERROR, I suspect it
is a false pos since it says that xml2 package can not be installed.
My main concern is about Oracle Solaris 10, x86, 32 bit, R-release where
the function ExportToReport leads to the error reported in the title see:
https://artifacts.r-hub.io/IFC_0.1.2.tar.gz-0e84aed564a1488894eb7e34990443af/IFC.Rcheck/IFC-Ex.Rout

However I got no error on  Oracle Solaris 10, x86, 32 bit, R release,
Oracle Developer Studio 12.6

Some googling points to https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues/2252.
The code of ExportToReport, is here
https://github.com/gitdemont/IFC/blob/master/R/ExportToReport.R,
The issue links this solaris error to ggplot but threads also mention grid
/ font...
So my guess is that it could be related with the fact that I apply font
modifications through gridExtra::ttheme_default and in pdf() by using
"serif" in ExportToReport

Do you think, this is only on rhub but will not happen on CRAN ?
I did several modifications since last CRAN update, but previous CRAN
version of IFC package already included those font family modifications in
ExportToReport (https://github.com/cran/IFC/blob/master/R/ExportToReport.R)
and did not produce solaris error in CRAN results (
https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_IFC.html)

Nonetheless should it be safer to use other font family only for solaris ?
In such case what would you be your recommendations to check it (e.g.
Sys.info()["sysname"], I don't know the returned value on solaris) and to
apply another font family (but which one)

Maybe, it is something else. But, in such case, I have absolutely no idea
where it comes from what I can do.

Best,
Yohann

Replying to myself and with some additional investigations

I just tried once again on rhub - Oracle Solaris 10, x86, 32 bit, R-release
and got the same error with a conditional font family modification where
when
Sys.info()["sysname"] == "SunOS",
- pdf(), family argument is set to its default value "Helvetica"
- gridExtra::ttheme_default, base_family argument is se to its default
value ""
Otherwise, "serif" is used

In addition, the error in solaris shares "polygon edge not found" lately
reported by I?aki ?car
Though, I don't have the warning part, and mine is not happening during
vignette rebuilding

I have posted this question first to r-help at r-project.org and Bert Gunter informs me that it was better for this discussion list that I didn't know.

Hello everyone,

I am a little bit stucked on the problem to include a database with
utf-8 string in a package. When I submit it to CRAN, it reports NOTES
for several Unix system and I try to find a solution (if it exists) to
not have these NOTES.

The database has references and some names have non ASCII characters.

* First I don't agree at all with the solution proposed here:

https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Encoding-issues

"First, consider carefully if you really need non-ASCIItext."

If a language has non ASCII characters, it is not just to make the
writting nicer of more complex, it is because it changes the prononciation.

* Then I try to find solution to not have these NOTES.

For example, here is a reference with utf-8 characters

> DatabaseTSD$Reference[211]

[1] Hern?ndez-Montoya, V., P?ez, V.P. & Ceballos, C.P. (2017) Effects of
temperature on sex determination and embryonic development in the
red-footed tortoise, Chelonoidis carbonarius. Chelonian Conservation and
Biology 16, 164-171.

When I convert the characters into unicode, I get indeed only ASCII
characters. Perfect.

>   iconv(DatabaseTSD$Reference[211], "UTF-8", "ASCII", "Unicode")

[1] "Hern<U+00E1>ndez-Montoya, V., P<U+00E1>ez, V.P. & Ceballos, C.P.
(2017) Effects of temperature on sex determination and embryonic
development in the red-footed tortoise, Chelonoidis carbonarius.
Chelonian Conservation and Biology 16, 164-171."

Then I have no NOTES when I checked the package with database in UNIX...
but how can I print the reference back with original characters ?

Thanks a lot to point me to best practices to include databases with
non-ASCII characters and not have NOTES while submitted package to CRAN.

   "Any byte will be allowed in a quoted character string but ?\uxxxx?
    escapes should be used for non-ASCII characters. However, non-ASCII
    character strings may not be usable in some locales and may display
    incorrectly in others."

So you could try to use such escapes, e.g.

    stringi::stri_escape_unicode("Hern?ndez-Montoya")
    ## [1] "Hern\\u00e1ndez-Montoya"

You could also try to submit the package to CRAN with a comment about the NOTE. There is interesting information in https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/note-on-utf-8-strings-by-goodpractice-gp/2165/

Good luck!

Hi Everyone,

I am developing a package (called mypackage in the text below) that uses reticulate to call a Python script for computational efficiency.  At some point during the development of the package I read that it would be good to verify installation of Miniconda.  Thus mypackage includes an onLoad.R file that asks users to either confirm that Miniconda is installed or to proceed with installation on Miniconda.  When I run devtools::check() I get a NOTE related to my onLoad.R file, and this seems to be causing problems when I submit the package to CRAN.  There are no WARNINGs or ERRORs.  Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Vonn

The help page ?.onLoad suggests it should normally be silent.  Users 
might not know which package your message came from, because loading can 
happen indirectly, if some other package they requested imports from 
yours, for instance.

So if you put your startup message on .onAttach, you probably won't get 
the note.

I can't really see why it should be "recommended" to handle installing system requirements inside an R package. There are many ways to satisfy such requirements that would not involve miniconda. If you were determined to provide such support, doing so in a normal function documented in a vignette seems more appropriate.

Hey,

First of all I see that you need a numpy package so I assume some
matrix/tensor operations are done. There is no difference in performance
between R and Python if you are using proper BLAS and LAPACK.
 Windows users might use MRO MKL, Linux users openblas and the Mac os
vecLib has to be activated. I done some benchmarks some time ago,
https://github.com/Polkas/RPbenchmarks. Unfortunately they are done only
partly.

If we talking about system requirements as i see you need only python and a
one library numpy. As i remember rsconnect using python script and do not
need any additional system requirements.
https://github.com/rstudio/rsconnect/blob/main/inst/resources/environment.py.
they run it if python is available, if not other code is executed.

Have a nice day.

Best,
Maciej Nasinaki

Hi Maciej and Jeff,

Thanks for your responses.  Duncan Murdoch offered a suggestion about using .onAttach instead, so I plan to give that a shot.  If the NOTE still pops up, then I may drop the message altogether and instead include some text about Python/numpy installation in the vignette.  FYI, the package includes a function that provides the same functionality without the need to call Python, albeit with longer compute times.

Best,

Vonn

I done some benchmarks some time ago, https://github.com/Polkas/RPbenchmarks<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/github.com/Polkas/RPbenchmarks__;!!Ls64Rlj6!kL0561pdH-8oq5ytLKAlC-Euctbq1fg-2itjGkFjGq8-IjU-SU60uOHmvZxKEIPl2OsnSTO5tw$>. Unfortunately they are done only partly.

If we talking about system requirements as i see you need only python and a one library numpy. As i remember rsconnect using python script and do not need any additional system requirements. https://github.com/rstudio/rsconnect/blob/main/inst/resources/environment.py<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/github.com/rstudio/rsconnect/blob/main/inst/resources/environment.py__;!!Ls64Rlj6!kL0561pdH-8oq5ytLKAlC-Euctbq1fg-2itjGkFjGq8-IjU-SU60uOHmvZxKEIPl2OtiXvOhXA$>. they run it if python is available, if not other code is executed.

Have a nice day.

At some point during the development of the package I read that it would be good to verify installation of Miniconda.  Thus mypackage includes an onLoad.R file that asks users to either confirm that Miniconda is installed or to proceed with installation on Miniconda.  When I run devtools::check() I get a NOTE related to my onLoad.R file, and this seems to be causing problems when I submit the package to CRAN.  There are no WARNINGs or ERRORs.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] README.html doesn't show figures in CRAN web
Message-ID: <CACr7k5+o1nZ5odJAA-Km0JjiVO6xBKw2x51eD5on5HTc0Ero_g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I have a package at CRAN that includes a README.html which includes two
figures created by two R chunks in the README.Rmd. Once the package were at
CRAN, I noticed that
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mypkg/readme/README.html doesn't
show the figures. Instead, the usual icon of image not found is displayed.

Locally, README.html works fine (both figures are shown). I think the
problem could be that
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mypkg/readme/README.html doesn't
find the figure files because I possibly put them in a wrong folder.

In my Rmd, I set

knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.path = "man/figures/README-")

I can see the folder "figures" is created in "man" but, "figures" folder is
not in the tar.gz. I didn't notice that before because I didn't get any
warning nor note.

In "R packages", section 20.5.2, I can see, they set

knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.path = "README-)

Should I set fig.path = "README-" instead of fig.path =
"man/figures/README-" even if my html is not for GitHub? Where should I
place the png figure files created by the Rmd?

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

The rgl package does something similar to you, though it includes the 
.md file instead of the .html.  The output spec is

output: github_document

CRAN processes the .md to produce the display properly.  This also works 
on Github.

You do need to make sure the man/figures directory is included in the 
tarball.  Check your .Rbuildignore file for patterns that might exclude it.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] LaTeX issues on r-devel-windows-x86_64-gcc10-UCRT?
Message-ID: <466C64F0-9D4C-4848-88FB-D6B6D0F629BA@uni-greifswald.de>

Dear all,

lately, an error and two warnings occurred for our package dataquieR on the platform r-devel-windows-x86_64-gcc10-UCRT (https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_dataquieR.html). 

Unfortunately, error messages/warnings are likely related to the test system?s configuration/setup:

  - Missing file /msys64/home/tomas/ucrt3/svn/ucrt3/r_packages/patches_idx.rds

  - "LaTeX errors? without further specification, rather unspecific.

I have now re-built this environment as close as I could according to the platform description and given my infrastructure. In this setup, I had a missing font in the end in my test installation. 

After I had applied this: https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/129523 (setup configuration for the font ts1-zi4r), the pdf could be created. The warning about missing patches_idx.rds, I could not reproduce, but this may be less relevant anyway.

The setup, I used (hopefully close to r-devel-windows-x86_64-gcc10-UCRT) was

  - Microsoft Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC, 10.0.17763 Build 17763
  - R 4.2.0 Pre Release UCRT3 downloaded today from r-project.org as the only R installation
  - Rtools 4.0.2.0.1 downloaded today from r-project.org as the only Rtools installation
  - For TeX, I installed MiKTeX 21.6 as the only TeX installation.
  - all binaries were put on the PATH environment variable

?? 

Now my question: Is this related to CRAN?s r-devel-windows-x86_64-gcc10-UCRT and can that be fixed there? Whom should I contact at CRAN?

Thank you in advance,

Stephan

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] What is a "retired"package?
Message-ID: <DM6PR04MB4474AEDCBB0A297CE1250A25F1A19@DM6PR04MB4474.namprd04.prod.outlook.com>

I received a request that I remove the 'plyr' package from the Imports for my package, because plyr is retired. Indeed, the README file for plyr states:

    > plyr is retired: this means only changes necessary to keep it on CRAN will be made. 
    > We recommend using dplyr (for data frames) or purrr (for lists) instead.

This says "retired" but it also suggests that plyr will continue to be maintained. And that is a good thing because plyr has over 700 direct reverse-dependents, and almost 2000 if we include indirect reverse dependencies. 

So it seems to me that it isn't a problem at all to have my package import plyr. I use its 'aaply' and 'alply' functions, which are like 'apply' but work for any dimensional array. There are no obvious replacements in purrr or dplyr, and if there were and I used them instead, it would increase my indirect dependencies to several packages that are not actually needed.

The user requesting that I drop plyr states that this is needed to satisfy regulatory needs, that it is problematic to qualify my package since it imports a retired package. 

So my question is: Is there a specific meaning in CRAN for "retired," or is that just loose language from the plyr developers? I did not find the term in "CRAN Repository Policy" or "Writing R Extensions." It appears that my user or their regulatory agency thinks it means that it could be deprecated in the near future. (If that is indeed what it means, there are 700+ packages in trouble!) Otherwise, perhaps the appropriate request may be to the plyr maintainers to modify how they describe its status, so as to avoid confusion.

Hello,

We renamed "retired" to "superseded" some time ago to avoid any
confusion. Superseded functions and packages continue to be maintained
on CRAN for the foreseeable future and it is safe to depend on them.
See the "superseded" definition in https://tidyverse.org/lifecycle/.

plyr probably still mentions "retired" because it is rarely updated
(only when a CRAN failure requires attention).

Best,
Lionel

There is nothing official about that term. However, the meaning as intended by the package authors seems pretty clear to me, and if some organization decides not to allow software that is not being maintained to be relied upon then that is their decision. I don't think slapping a different label on "I am not fixing this hot mess" is going to change that organization's stance, and expecting the author to play that game is unreasonable.

Welcome to the downside of package interdependencies. I highly recommend that you migrate away from plyr, either by absorbing the key functions you need from it or by relying on different packages.

I did not find the term in "CRAN Repository Policy" or "Writing R Extensions." It appears that my user or their regulatory agency thinks it means that it could be deprecated in the near future. (If that is indeed what it means, there are 700+ packages in trouble!) Otherwise, perhaps the appropriate request may be to the plyr maintainers to modify how they describe its status, so as to avoid confusion.

There is nothing official about that term. However, the meaning as intended by the package authors seems pretty clear to me, and if some organization decides not to allow software that is not being maintained to be relied upon then that is their decision. I don't think slapping a different label on "I am not fixing this hot mess" is going to change that organization's stance, and expecting the author to play that game is unreasonable.

Welcome to the downside of package interdependencies. I highly recommend that you migrate away from plyr, either by absorbing the key functions you need from it or by relying on different packages.

thanks for the report. This is due to a problem that prevented building 
the patch index (so yes, the test system), I've fixed it earlier today 
and new results should appear in about a day.

Thanks, I will try this out when the current run finishes, if the LaTeX 
error still appears.

The machine uses the latest MiKTeX (21.8), which crashes e.g. when 
running "texify --version segfaults". I've reported this (and it may 
well be an error that has been reported before - 
https://github.com/MiKTeX/miktex/issues/921). I will have a look in the 
logs when the new results appear, it may be related.

In principle, you can always write to the CRAN address and your email 
will be forwarded to the right person. Currently I am running these checks.

As you previously quoted:

> plyr is retired: this means only changes necessary to keep it on CRAN will be made.

That excludes bugfixes related to any specific use cases it is not currently capable of handling. In other words, if it doesn't handle the data you pass along to it from your users, or there turns out to be a security problem (I agree, not likely, but remember these agencies don't shade things by "likely") then the plyr maintainers aren't promising to fix it. Take it "as-is". This is exactly what this "agency" you are being hassled by is concerned about... not the label applied to that status.

apply() also recently got a 'simplify' argument, which means you request
its output be returned as a list, too (i.e., to replace alply).

OK. Well, as Noah has pointed out, I can just use apply to do what I need, and get plyr out of the picture. 

But for the broader question, Jeff is saying that there really are 700 packages that are in potential trouble!

I think that's rather an overstatement of the problem ? there's
nothing wrong with plyr; it's just no longer under active development.
If anything, plyr is one of the safest packages to depend upon because
you can know it will never change :)

Dear Thomas,

thank you for your quick reply. I'll consider then writing to the CRAN address earler, if I have strong hints that the build/check system may cause a warning/error. 

So, I'll wait for the next check-run then. If I can help you in any way with fixing the pipelines, just ask... CRAN is doing a great job and we definitley benefit strongly from it, so I should be able to find some time to help.

Thank you again, hope we can get this fixed soon,

Greetings

Stephan

I agree... but trouble is in the eyes of the beholder. If OP's approval process requires use of actively-maintained software, then use of code depending on one of these "retired"/"superceded" packages could indeed be a problem... for the OP. OP cannot expect to be able to impose those requirements on others though.

Hadley,

As I suspected, and a good point. But please note that the term "retired" causes angst, and it may be good to change that to "superceded" or something else.

As a side note, I'll mention that I myself am retired, and I'll claim that that does not make me less dependable. But one difference in retirement is that I now care less about public embarrassment, such as not knowing that all along, I could have used base::apply instead of plyr::aaply.

Yes, as Lionel said that is why we have changed our terminology to
superseded ? we wanted to imply that a retired package was still a
useful member of society, if not working full-time anymore, but most
people seem to think that retired means that we took the package out
behind the shed and put it out of its misery.

yes, but we'll become "superseded" long before we want to admit it ;-)

Philosophy aside, albeit not uninteresting, I am wondering about the
etiquette of developing a package and then years later dealing with how to
have it replaced carefully. Do creators and maintainers have any obligation
and especially when there is a large remaining embedded base of users. We
may have quite a few Y2K type problems in the sense that some people cannot
easily change what is being used. Other languages, like Python, have been
dealing with how the newer language features (version 3) have serious
incompatibilities with earlier versions and yet some stay with what they
have.

Hadley Wickham for example, has been involved in multiple packages including
cases like ggplot where it was replaced by another package with enough
incompatibilities that it might merit another name. I am not sure what
exactly was in plyr when it stopped being changed but in some ways the dplyr
package seems to focus on data.frames and plyr was more general. And, I
suspect, dplyr also tried to do things consistent with new design approaches
such as standardizing where arguments to a function go. It may well be
faster when used as planned.

But as a possibility, I suspect you could theoretically take the source code
for a package that has largely been replaced by others and sometimes make a
sort of compatibility version that consists largely of pointers to other
packages.

Specifically, the documentation could contain a section that suggests
alternatives to use. I suspect quite a few of the included functions may be
available in base R or another commonly used package (such as the tidyverse
collection) and just using the new one, perhaps with some alteration in how
it is called, might help guide existing users away to something more likely
to be maintained.

And sometimes, it might be weirdly possible to have a volunteer do something
a tad odd and set up a way to replace the functions in the package. A
function call like f(z, data) might simply be mapped into a call to
other::g(data, z, flag=FALSE) if that made sense. Other fairly small
wrappers might do more such re-direction. Obviously, this would be of
limited use if other packages would need to be loaded. I can imagine leaving
a package intact and adding a new function with a name like supercede() that
would make such a re-arrangement when asked to.

The user would normally call:

library(plyr)
plyr::supercede()

Without that additional line, nothing changes. But after calling it, you may
now be in a partial compatibility mode.

I now retire without being superseded.

Dear Duncan,

Indeed, I had accidentally deleted man/figures before tar.gz. Silly error.
Now fixed and working. Thanks for the light.

Message-ID: <b00a095afb474295a642a9dcd48a1535@plus.ac.at>

Dear community,

When building my package 'SleepCycles' using devtools::check, devtools::check_win_devel, and devtools::check_rhub, I do not get warnings, errors, or notes. Nevertheless, there seems to be an error when building the vignettes eventually (https://cran-archive.r-project.org/web/checks/2021/2021-09-06_check_results_SleepCycles.html), which I did not notice and which led to the removal of the package.

Does anyone know how to solve this? I read something about changing the vignette engine, but when I tried this, I ran into other issues.

I cannot replicate the error, but simply resubmitting will most likely result in the same issue again.

Best,
Christine

Dear Christine,

Looking at the chunk that causes the error https://github.com/cran/SleepCycles/blob/141186934418af387f0af257e3079af588e72844/vignettes/introduction.Rmd#L50-L56 (via the CRAN mirror maintained by R-hub):

* You should not install packages from a vignette. You can add "eval=FALSE" as a chunk option.
* Regarding the other lines in that chunk, they do not provoke an error but are not recommended by all. See e.g. https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/

Good luck with re-submission!

Ma?lle.

thanks. The new results are now available and the patches issue was 
resolved.

These results are still with MiKTeX 21.8, with some crashes (e.g. when 
building the documentation for R), but it seems dataquieR is not 
affected. I will downgrade to 21.6, which should resolve these - I've 
tested that in the automated VM setup at

Hello,

It's better to get rid of this NOTE, by listing bookdown in VignetteBuilder and Suggests, not Imports see https://blog.r-hub.io/2020/06/03/vignettes/#infrastructure--dependencies-for-vignettes That's actually what you did in another package https://github.com/cran/gamclass/blob/master/DESCRIPTION (it's a coincidence I found a package of yours via code search in CRAN GitHub mirror :-) ).

Ma?lle.

 IFC package - Solaris error polygon edge not found
 (zero-width or zero-height?)

Message-ID: <CAGf8esh1TWG-Vs31Le0BxLC9TwgWf74E7MO4AKcg07b9vGWdGQ@mail.gmail.com>

I had very hard time with this error. But I think I have solved it now.
I made several tests recently trying to identify where it came from.
This cryptic error was not random, I was able to reproduce it.

It only appeared on rhub  Oracle Solaris 10, x86, 32 bit, R-release and not
on rhub  Oracle Solaris 10, x86, 32 bit, R release, Oracle Developer Studio
12.6

It happened when I try to grid.draw a gtable object produced by
gridExtra::arrangeGrob
This gtable object is produced without any errors and consists of a lattice
plot (transformed with grob()) + a tableGrob() of a small matrix.

If I grid.draw the lattice plot (transformed with grob()) alone, I got no
error
If I grid.draw the tableGrob() alone, I got no error
However, when I tried to draw the combination of both, I was getting the
error:
grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y,  :
  polygon edge not found (zero-width or zero-height?)
Calls: [my function name] ... <Anonymous> -> heightDetails ->
heightDetails.text -> grid.Call

This error only occurred with one of the graphs I wanted to produce (number
5).
In my tests, I also included another graph (number 4) which did not lead to
any error.

Luckily, I found a blog by Dana Paige Seidel
https://www.danaseidel.com/2018-09-01-ATidySummer/ with a chapter called
"The bug of grid destiny" that pointed to scales "this particular error is
triggered when special characters are used in axis tick labels". This was
really helpful because the scale was indeed one of the differences between
graph4 and graph5.
graph5 has a log-like scale whereas graph4 has a linear scale. To further
test this I produced graph4 with a log-like scale and graph5 with a linear
scale and this time the error happened with graph4.

All this was a long quest, because each time I had to tweak my code,
reupload it to rhub and wait for the artifacts to look at all the print and
str, ... things I had to introduce to understand were the bug came from. By
the way, many thanks to rhub people for providing us their amazing platform
to test our packages !

Looking deeper at the scales... For log-like, several ticks are drawn but
only main ticks are labelled with values, whereas for linear all ticks that
are displayed are labelled.
In the log-like scale the labels of the non-main ticks were labelled with
"".

My guess was that in some circumstances those "" produced text grobs with
non.finite height that triggered the error. Replacing the "" by " " (with a
whitespace) solved the issue

Though, I still can't explain why this only happened on Solaris nor why the
error is not triggered when the plot is drawn alone without the tableGrob.

FWIW,
Yohann

Indeed, dataquieR now doesn?t show any errors any more. If I find the time, I?ll try MikTeX 21.8 later today, maybe, I can examine the issues a bit deeper then.

Have a great day,

Message-ID: <A99E183D-D886-43F1-80A6-EA80A4DDA245@noaa.gov>

Hi All:

I am getting dinged again on CRAN  (just Solaris for some reason),  and the problem is how to exit if there is a failure of accessing the resource,  I know it has been discussed here before,  but I just am not understanding what is desired to end properly. As I have been reminded:

'Packages which use Internet resources should fail gracefully with an informative message
if the resource is not available or has changed (and not give a check warning nor error).'

All internet calls are wrapped in 'try()'.  If that shows an error,  I  write a message to the screen about the error,  and call stop(), perhaps with a further message in that call.   Somehow this does not appear to meet the standard.    Can someone then please tell me what I should do instead.  The point is I have checked that the access to the internet resources has worked,  i have seen that it hasn't,  now what should be the steps to take to exit gracefully.

I also want to add to what others have said about the frustrations of dealing with Solaris.  I have spent a fair amount of time getting things to  work with Solaris which no one uses.  In this instance the package test is only failing on Solaris.   Not a good use of limited time IMO.

Thanks for any advice.

-Roy

   I think you're not supposed to stop().

   You should just proceed with the other tests (skipping any 
tests/examples that depend on access to the inaccessible internet 
resources, or values derived from the failing call, to work)

   Does that help?

We've summarized some advice around graceful packages in this chapter of the HTTP testing in R book:?https://books.ropensci.org/http-testing/graceful.html I hope this can help too!?
 
 
  Le ven., sept. 24, 2021 ? 17:03, Ben Bolker<bbolker at gmail.com> a ?crit:   ? I think you're not supposed to stop().

? You should just proceed with the other tests (skipping any 
tests/examples that depend on access to the inaccessible internet 
resources, or values derived from the failing call, to work)

? Does that help?

Just so I am clear,  I should not call stop(),  but instead call a return() and return something or other  (there is nothing to skip to - it is doing a data download and either it works or it failed).  Is there a preferred something to return?  And it is okay to write a message to the screen?  

I should add that when I first ran into this awhile back I asked what "failed gracefully" means,  and never received a response.  To me,  writing out a message to the user and stopping is graceful exit, but obviously it is not.  What would help then, since this problem has been cited by others, is more explicit guidelines as to what constitutes a graceful exit with examples.  My $0.02

Hi,

Regarding Solaris, while the criteria is unknown, it seems Solaris can
be excluded from the CRAN check targets when there's a good reason not
to support Solaris. My package got a failure on Solaris check and I
resubmitted with the following comment, then Solaris disappeared from
the check results [1].

> I would like to request to exclude Solaris from the build targets because Solaris is not a supported platform by Rust. This should be in line with the treatments of other CRAN packages that use Rust; gifski, baseflow, and salso are not built on Solaris. I'm sorry that I didn't write this in the first submission.

Again, I'm not sure on what criteria they decided to accept my
suggestion. It's unclear if your package is the case. Some months ago,
I asked "How can I avoid Solaris build on CRAN?" on this mailing list
[2], but I got no reply. So, probably no one knows the right answer...

Best,
Hiroaki Yutani

Grace is in the eyes of the beholder.

Using stop in your functions can be perfectly valid. But within the context of examples or tests you need to catch those errors because one key definition of success in normal building of a package is that no uncaught errors occur. So either don't call those functions during package check, or catch the errors and move on. The former is probably best (no point in wasting time if you are going to ignore the failure anyway)... only run them interactively or when running full tests during development.

I don't think it matters what you return, as long as the caller 
understands that it didn't get any data.  If this is a function you 
export, make sure to describe that possibility in its help page.

As far as I know it's okay to use message() (or cat() or print(), but 
message() is preferred) to give your message, just not stop() or 
warning() -- those will signal a problem to CRAN that you should fix.

Thanks to all who replied.  I want to especially point out Maelle's response because as I said I am not the first person to raise this question in terms of accessing internet resources.  Yes,  graceful is in the eye of the beholder,  which i why such guidelines are really helpful.

Can you tell if the failure to download was due to a Solaris-specific issue
or due to the Solaris test machine not being fully connected to the
internet?

Not off-hand.  it is weird that the only error is on Solaris.  I do test on the r-hub Solaris before submission.  But at the same time,  given some of the responses that I have received (which I thank) I probably don't meet the CRAN idea of "graceful".  Easy enough for me to change as I am catching these so just need to change what I do.

I have seen other posts where people comment that the Solaris test machine appears to have an internet connection a good bit slower or less reliable than other test machines,  so timeouts occur,  but I can't discern that with what I have.

out of ignorance, i ask ...

in your package's operational code ("its API", or whatever), when a
required internet access fails, i would think a message and a stop(),
might be the reasonable thing to do.

in examples or tests, either doing the access itself, or calling your
operational code, one might try() and not stop(), but, rather, go on to
the next example/test.

in your comment above, is the try()/stop() in your operational code or
in your tests/examples?

cheers, Greg

Message-ID: <bef68b00-0b1a-f56c-22ee-f75888b489bc@dds.nl>


I am trying solve an issue where my tests run fine when run with R CMD 
check, but not with R CMD check --as-cran. In the tests pandoc is called 
using system; pandoc then calls R again with a script which is part of 
the package. The last part seems to fail, see error message below:

   Running ?test_mdweave.R?
  ERROR
Running the tests in ?tests/test_mdweave.R? failed.
Last 13 lines of output:
   > message("Weave file")

   > mdweave(fn)
   Error running filter 
/home/eoos/git/tinymarkdown/work/tinymarkdown.Rcheck/tinymarkdown/scripts/filter.R:
   Filter returned error status 1
   >


As I mentioned, this only happend when testing with --as-cran. Without 
--as-cran the output is:

* checking tests ...
   Running ?test_file_subs_ext.R?
   Running ?test_mdtangle.R?
   Running ?test_mdweave.R?
  OK
* checking for unstated dependencies in vignettes ... OK


Note that I already set the environment variable R_TEST to "" 
(https://github.com/r-lib/testthat/issues/144; I am not using testthat). 
This was also needed to get the check without --as-cran running.

One thing that I notice it that R_LIBS and R_LIBS_SITE between the two 
ways of running R CMD check. However, I can't think why this would lead 
to the tests failing.

Suggestions are welcome.

In case someone wants to look, the code is here:

Thanks,

try/stop is in the operational code.  But it is easy enough to make it so that the code always returns something, even when there is an internet access problem.

As I said,  if  "failing gracefully" and ever actually been defined with examples life would have been much easier for a number of packages developers.

I think that the important part is to catch that stop() in your _tests
or examples_, so that a stop() raised by a connection error
inside the code of your package wouldn't fail your \example{} block or a
test in tests/*.R.

Good:
R/myfunction.R: if (connection_failed) stop(informative_message)

Bad:
man/myfunction.Rd:
\example{ myfunction(foo) }

(During CRAN testing, connection fails, the exception reaches the R CMD
check process and fails the test.)

Good:
man/myfunction.Rd
\example{ try(myfunction(foo)) # may fail because of connection errors }

Here, the exception is raised but handled. Bonus points if you use
tryCatch(...) and only catch the "connection failed" conditions,
allowing all other errors to propagate and still fail the tests. It's
possible if you construct a condition object (x <- simpleError(...))
and append to its class(): class(x) <- c(class(x),
'connection_failed'). The resulting error can still be raised with
stop(x). tryCatch() will then be able to call your handler only for
connection_failed errors.

Raising an exception is a valid way of dealing with connection errors
for functions that rely on outside world to fulfil their promise.

I noticed in the Writing R Extensions manual, it says that within a
NAMESPACE file, "Only very simple conditional processing of if statements
is implemented.".
I tried it out myself by importing a Windows exclusive function:


if (.Platform$OS.type == "windows")
    importFrom(utils, getWindowsHandles)


It also says in the manual that a NAMESPACE file "is not processed as R
code", so I'm wondering if anyone knows exactly how if statements are
handled within a NAMESPACE file.

For a question like this, going to the source is really the only choice. 
  NAMESPACE is parsed when the package is installed, using the function 
parseNamespaceFile from the base package.

What that function does is to parse NAMESPACE as if it is R code, then 
go through the unevaluate expressions.  If it comes across one that is 
an "if", it evaluates it in the global environment.  But usually that's 
not *your* global environment, that's the global environment that is in 
place while the package is being installed.

If the condition is TRUE, it handles the clause that follows; if FALSE, 
it will look at the "else" clause.

So your

   if (.Platform$OS.type == "windows")

would be fine because .Platform is in the base package, so it's 
guaranteed to be available.  I suspect something like

   if (stats::runif(1) > 0.5) export(someFunction)

would work too, for a particularly frustrating experience for your 
users.  It would mean half the installs export the function, and half don't.

Returning to the original question, if it's helpful: I'd like to know what
constraints led to considering an export only available on Windows, and see
if we can suggest some other designs. It'd be good to keep the user's
mental model abstracted from the platform they're working on. There are
often unavoidable differences due to platform, but usually they're handled

Part of R CMD check --as-cran is placing fake R and Rscript executables
on the PATH (but currently not on Windows):

https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/blob/98f33a2a7b22f400d51220162cf400a0cfdc9aaf/src/library/tools/R/check.R#L279

Does the pandoc script use the R_HOME variable to call the correct R
executable?

Hello,


I'm updating my package 'this.path' which is supposed to retrieve the
absolute path of the executing script when called. It's similar to 'here',
except that 'here' constructs paths relative to a project directory,
whereas 'this.path' constructs paths relative to script directories. I was
updating the section where I retrieve the executing script's path while
running from a script open in Rgui for Windows, and I needed
utils::getWindowsHandles to do such a thing. But utils::getWindowsHandles
is a Windows only function, I
would imagine that 'utils' contains a similar line of code as above:


if (.Platform$OS.type == "windows")
    getWindowsHandles <- function() ...


and then in the NAMESPACE:


if (.Platform$OS.type == "windows")
    export(getWindowsHandles)


so I'd like to change my code to getWindowsHandles and import
getWindowsHandles from utils, but I can only do that on Windows, and so the
conditional importing should work for me. At no point does my function
mis-behave because of a attempting to use a function that isn't exported on
that platform, because within the function it only uses getWindowsHandles
if the OS is Windows.

What if you are on Windows but running R at the command prompt, or via cygwin, or in the console window of RStudio?

This seems unstable to me.

Sorry, too much context missing.  What's unstable?

I don't have cigwin installed but from the command window, the terminal
that Git installs, RGui, and RStudio they all return "windows" for the
.Platform$OS.type for me.

Expecting a window handle relevant to the script to exist for the purpose of identifying a path seem to be orthogonal problems to me. But Andrew has indicated offlist that he has alternate code for other cases only uses this technique when appropriate.

I still feel this is too convoluted as a way to identify a path, but if he covers all cases then my opinion is just an opinion.

You are correct, it most definitely is a convoluted way to identify a path,
but this is one incredibly specific scenario. The case I'm talking about
only occurs when running a script in Rgui for Windows using Ctrl+R (or
pasting into the R Console) to run a piece of code. Scenarios such as
running from the Windows command-line / / Unix terminal / / using source,
sys.source, RStudio's debugSource, and testthat::source_file are handled in
a much different and less convoluted manner.
And in this case, the window handle relevant to the script has to exist,
otherwise you couldn't open the script in Rgui in the first place. I'm not
disagreeing that it's a horrible way to retrieve the path of the executing
script, but it's the only way if you're running from an open script in Rgui
for Windows.
