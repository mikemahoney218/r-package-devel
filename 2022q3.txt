Tomas,
Do you have any logging in the build environment that could tell you
whether the environment is running into resource constraints?  I can
imagine IO (disk or network) or CPU contention with that kind of workload
and memory pressure would be easy to identify.

I was curious about repeatability to rule out the option that it was 
simply that Winbuilder was overloaded at the time of checking the package.

Is the current version that also caused the problem available anywhere?

It would be difficult to profile without being able to reproduce on a 
machine that can be used interactively and exclusively for the profiling.
Still, you could try narrowing it down by instrumenting the package - 
adding some timings, printing the outputs, and sending such instrumented 
package to Winbuilder

And if you told us what the package is you are tasking about or gave us 
access to the package sources, we could easily check that. Without 
reproducible examples we really cannot help.

Best,

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Slow down in R 4.2.x
Message-ID: <13505960.q0Az33yFfb@ryz>

Dear list,

independent of the thread on this list about slow examples on R 4.2 on windows 
I have discovered over the last few days that some of my benchmarks (look for 
t4 and t9) run by a factor of 3 slower on R 4.2.x than on R 4.1.3 [1].

This is on Linux, using my own backported R packages for R 4.2.x and locally 
compiled versions (with default configure options) of R-4-1-branch on two 
different CPUs. The results for R 4.2.1 are only slightly modulated by the use 
of different BLAS version (openblas-serial versus atlas versus lapack).

I also tested the R 4.0.4 version that is part of Debian bullseye, it is as 
fast as the locally compiled R 4.1.3.

I went through the NEWS for R 4.2.0 (because the first slow results were 
obtained using that version), but the only change I could imagine causing such 
a change is the additional check of the length of the arguments && and ||.

Any other thoughts?

Johannes

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Seeking feedback on a package before submitting to
 CRAN
Message-ID: <GV0P278MB0417D418D560D7E2519E6BEAECBD9@GV0P278MB0417.CHEP278.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Dear all,?

I have written a small?lightweight utility package for R developers that implements opinionated assertion checking routines. This is mostly a drop-in replacement for base::stopifnot() but with some additional features that simplify debugging and error location. Before submitting the package on CRAN I was hoping that someone here would be so kind to have a quick look and maybe offer some feedback. The package is called "precondition" and can be found on GitHub here:

? https://github.com/tzakharko/precondition?

If you would like to leave some feedback I have created a GitHub issue just for that:?

  https://github.com/tzakharko/precondition/issues/1

Here is a quick summary as to what this package is about: it implements a thematic collection of assertion routines that check some conditions and report an informative error if the conditions are not TRUE. The routines have been inspired by similar mechanisms in the Swift programming language and discussion on the Swift design mailing lists. There are three assertion routines:

- precondition(x>0) to check inputs/environment before executing some code (to be used to check function arguments, for example)

- postcondition(.value. > 0) to check the function result?

- sanity_check(!is.null(x)) to check internal assumptions/invariants of the algorithm and guard against bugs, will immediately abort the program bypassing error handling when failed. Sanity checks are internal assertions and failing them always mean that there is a critical bug ?in the code which would make any attempt at error recovery futile

Parts of the assertion predicate can be "embraced", which will print them on assertion failure, making it easier to see what went wrong, e.g.?

? x <- 0
? precondition({{x}} > 0)
??# Error:
? # ! precondition failure
? # ! `x > 0` is not TRUE
? # ?
? # ?`x` = dbl 10

The package README has some usage examples and background discussion.?

Thank you in advance for your help,?

Taras

P.S. To anticipate the mandatory (and justified) question, the reason why I decided to roll my own solution instead of using one of the existing packages (like the popular assertthat) is because I needed something very simple and with low performance overhead to help me debug my code and document program invariants.?
