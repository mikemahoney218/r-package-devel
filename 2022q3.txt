Tomas,
Do you have any logging in the build environment that could tell you
whether the environment is running into resource constraints?  I can
imagine IO (disk or network) or CPU contention with that kind of workload
and memory pressure would be easy to identify.

I was curious about repeatability to rule out the option that it was 
simply that Winbuilder was overloaded at the time of checking the package.

Is the current version that also caused the problem available anywhere?

It would be difficult to profile without being able to reproduce on a 
machine that can be used interactively and exclusively for the profiling.
Still, you could try narrowing it down by instrumenting the package - 
adding some timings, printing the outputs, and sending such instrumented 
package to Winbuilder

And if you told us what the package is you are tasking about or gave us 
access to the package sources, we could easily check that. Without 
reproducible examples we really cannot help.

Best,

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Slow down in R 4.2.x
Message-ID: <13505960.q0Az33yFfb@ryz>

Dear list,

independent of the thread on this list about slow examples on R 4.2 on windows 
I have discovered over the last few days that some of my benchmarks (look for 
t4 and t9) run by a factor of 3 slower on R 4.2.x than on R 4.1.3 [1].

This is on Linux, using my own backported R packages for R 4.2.x and locally 
compiled versions (with default configure options) of R-4-1-branch on two 
different CPUs. The results for R 4.2.1 are only slightly modulated by the use 
of different BLAS version (openblas-serial versus atlas versus lapack).

I also tested the R 4.0.4 version that is part of Debian bullseye, it is as 
fast as the locally compiled R 4.1.3.

I went through the NEWS for R 4.2.0 (because the first slow results were 
obtained using that version), but the only change I could imagine causing such 
a change is the additional check of the length of the arguments && and ||.

Any other thoughts?

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Seeking feedback on a package before submitting to
 CRAN
Message-ID: <GV0P278MB0417D418D560D7E2519E6BEAECBD9@GV0P278MB0417.CHEP278.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Dear all,?

I have written a small?lightweight utility package for R developers that implements opinionated assertion checking routines. This is mostly a drop-in replacement for base::stopifnot() but with some additional features that simplify debugging and error location. Before submitting the package on CRAN I was hoping that someone here would be so kind to have a quick look and maybe offer some feedback. The package is called "precondition" and can be found on GitHub here:

? https://github.com/tzakharko/precondition?

If you would like to leave some feedback I have created a GitHub issue just for that:?

  https://github.com/tzakharko/precondition/issues/1

Here is a quick summary as to what this package is about: it implements a thematic collection of assertion routines that check some conditions and report an informative error if the conditions are not TRUE. The routines have been inspired by similar mechanisms in the Swift programming language and discussion on the Swift design mailing lists. There are three assertion routines:

- precondition(x>0) to check inputs/environment before executing some code (to be used to check function arguments, for example)

- postcondition(.value. > 0) to check the function result?

- sanity_check(!is.null(x)) to check internal assumptions/invariants of the algorithm and guard against bugs, will immediately abort the program bypassing error handling when failed. Sanity checks are internal assertions and failing them always mean that there is a critical bug ?in the code which would make any attempt at error recovery futile

Parts of the assertion predicate can be "embraced", which will print them on assertion failure, making it easier to see what went wrong, e.g.?

? x <- 0
? precondition({{x}} > 0)
??# Error:
? # ! precondition failure
? # ! `x > 0` is not TRUE
? # ?
? # ?`x` = dbl 10

The package README has some usage examples and background discussion.?

Thank you in advance for your help,?

Taras

P.S. To anticipate the mandatory (and justified) question, the reason why I decided to roll my own solution instead of using one of the existing packages (like the popular assertthat) is because I needed something very simple and with low performance overhead to help me debug my code and document program invariants.?

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] R CMD checks URLs formatted for LaTeX instead of
 using the non-LaTeX URLs, and fails
Message-ID: <DBA296A1-ABF8-496E-A3D2-6A2FF8B4294A@gmx.net>

Hello, in my package documentation I want to include URLs with query string parameters and anchors, within a table. A minimally reproducible example is this content in file "man/mre.Rd":

\name{mre}
\title{mre}
\description{mre}
\details{
\tabular{l}{
  \ifelse{latex}{\href{https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=Infections\&rslt=With\#tableTop}{latex link}}{\href{https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=Infections&rslt=With#tableTop}{non-latex link}}
}}

The ifelse{}{}{} construct is necessary since ampersands in a table need to be escaped for LaTeX rendering.

Each of the following commands checks and renders the respective output correctly:

tools::checkRd("man/mre.Rd")
tools::Rd2txt("man/mre.Rd")
tools::Rd2latex("man/mre.Rd")
tools::Rd2HTML("man/mre.Rd")
system2("R", c("CMD", "Rd2pdf", "man/mre.Rd"))

However, rhub::check_for_cran() results in NOTES:

Found the following (possibly) invalid URLs:
  URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=Infections\&rslt=With\#tableTop
    From: man/mre.Rd
    Status: 400
    Message: Bad Request

Subsequently, CRAN maintainers refused accepting the package.

However, the underlying cause is that, during such checks, all apparent URLs are extracted from .Rd files, irrespective of any \ifelse{}{}{} constructs. This in turn is due to such checks involving calls to function ".get_urls_from_Rd" without setting its argument "ifdef" to TRUE.

Here is how to see this behaviour:

db <- tools::Rd_db(dir = ".")

# get functions
source("https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/src/library/tools/R/urltools.R")
source("https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/src/library/tools/R/utils.R")
.Rd_deparse <- tools:::.Rd_deparse
RdTags <- tools:::RdTags

# default, leading to invalid url in [1]
# > .get_urls_from_Rd(db)
# [1] "https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=Infections\\&rslt=With\\#tableTop"
# [2] "https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=Infections&rslt=With#tableTop"

# returning relevant valid url
#> .get_urls_from_Rd(db, ifdef = TRUE)
# [1] "https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=Infections&rslt=With#tableTop"

This can be addressed by either:

-- changing the signature of ".get_urls_from_Rd" in line 50 in https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/src/library/tools/R/urltools.R to read "ifdef = TRUE". Of note, this function has a code block to handle such ifdef constructs which indicates it should be possible to use them in Rd files.

-- changing the calling function "url_db_from_package_Rd_db" to include "ifdef = TRUE" on line 178 in https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/src/library/tools/R/urltools.R

Please advise how to advance on this issue, thank you very much.

Greetings
Ralf

This is a red herring. Ampersands do *not* need to be escaped in \href 
URLs. The problem is the hash symbol, which needs to be escaped if \href 
is nested within another markup macro, here \Tabular (from Rd.sty). This 
is a known limitation; Rd2latex will probably do the escaping in the 
future. It's good to see a use case.

I think currently the best solutions for you are to simply omit the 
#tableTop part in the LaTeX version or to not use such URLs inside a 
\tabular.

Hope this helps.
Best regards,

	Sebastian Meyer

Thanks Sebastian, 

but not only hash, also ampersand in \href in a tabular environment does need to be escaped, otherwise it does not latex (example below). I was not aware it is a known limitation for .Rd files despite searching for it. 

My use case (with eventually more meaningful query parameters and possibly anchors) would work if the existing R code block for handling \ifelse in urltools.R was activated as shown below, and this is my suggestion. How could I propose this? 

Kind regards,
Ralf

I stumbled over that problem a while ago and found that the escaping 
issue for the hash symbol is documented in the hyperref manual (but 
currently not accounted for by Rd2latex):

> The special characters # and ~ do *not* need to be escaped in any way (unless the command is used in the argument of another command). 

For example, this LaTeX code fails to compile:
\emph{\href{https://example.org/#}{hash}}
In contrast, an ampersand would not need to be escaped in that LaTeX 
example.

However, I can confirm that a LaTeX error results if an ampersand is 
used in a \href URL (but not in \url} that is passed to the special 
\Tabular LaTeX command from Rd.sty that is used by Rd2latex() for 
\tabular Rd input. Thank you for the heads-up.

I think it would be good to improve Rd2latex() / Rd.sty for URLs in 
\tabular that contain & or # rather than require special LaTeX treatment 
in the Rd source. My preliminary testing shows that hyperref is happy if 
[&%#] are always escaped in URLs (sometimes it is not necessary but it 
also does not seem to hurt).

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] problem with regdmp finding v4.2.x under Windows
Message-ID: <MEAPR01MB3829E66FE3C79E43E78A401693819@MEAPR01MB3829.ausprd01.prod.outlook.com>

Hi all,

In order to support my local students and other blind users, I install every version of R and re-build every document used, almost all of which are R markdown documents.

That means re-installing or updating packages as if I was a novice user following instructions. I try to give my students a clean start experience at the beginning of semester so that we're all using the same versions, and gives me time to sort out the messes before semester begins.

To do all of that efficiently, I make extensive use of batch files (Windows user alert) and a key ingredient of those batch files is that I avoid having to edit the R version number with each installation.

I've been using a Windows utility called regdmp to look in the registry for the highest version number. Up to v4.1.3, that was working extremely well for me.

In addition, I've been investigating quarto, and have struck the same problem because quarto looks for the path to Rscript.exe using the regdmp utility. I've had help from the quarto team, and we've established that the regdmp utility should be finding a version of R if one exists. On my newish laptop where there is just one R installation (4.2.0) regdmp fails to find any installation because it has an "Access denied" error message.

On my older desktop which has multiple R installations, I do not get an "Access denied" error, quarto finds the path to the 4.2.0 installation via brute force, but regdmp via my batch files gives me 4.1.x instead.

I'm currently able to provide the service to my students I want, but only by doing all R work by explicitly naming the version of R I want used. I really do want to get back to my previous workflow so that I just install new versions of R and carry on.

I'm now seeking your advice on the differences in installation of versions 4.2.x and 4.1.x that could have an impact on the Windows registry and therefore regdmp's ability to find the relevant entries there.


Many thanks,
Jonathan

Hi Jonathan,

Since we don't have a separate "R on Windows" or "R installation
and administration" mailing list, I think that this question is a
better fit for R-help, not R-package-devel. Although R-devel could be
an option too (if we determine that the R installer is doing something
wrong), the last time R installer has been significantly changed is
2020, so the problem is likely elsewhere.

Can you show us the relevant parts of the batch files?

What is the output of the following commands on the machines where you
have troubles finding R-4.2.x?

reg query "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\R-core"
reg query "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\R-core"

> 	[[alternative HTML version deleted]]

This mailing list removes the HTML parts from our messages, so we only
see the automatically-generated plain text part. In this case, I think
that your message wasn't damaged at all, but sometimes (especially when
pasting code or output examples) the results can be undesirable.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Changing optimization level when building package?
Message-ID: <2fe007d4-f575-34e6-714c-aa28edf86887@gmail.com>

I'm trying to track down a segfault in rgl on macOS, so I need to load R 
under lldb and set breakpoints in the C++ code, examine local variables, 
etc.  Reading WRE, I thought setting CXXFLAGS=-O0 in ~/.R/Makevars would 
do minimal optimization, but I'm still getting messages about local 
variables being optimized out.  For example, here's what I see during 
compiling:

   clang++ -mmacosx-version-min=10.13 -std=gnu++11 
-I"/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/include" -DNDEBUG 
-DHAVE_PNG_H -I/usr/local/Cellar/libpng/1.6.37/include/libpng16 -DDarwin 
-I/opt/X11/include -DHAVE_FREETYPE -Iext/ftgl 
-I/usr/local/opt/freetype/include/freetype2 -Iext  -I/usr/local/include 
-O0 -fPIC  -Wall -g -O2  -c x11gui.cpp -o x11gui.o

I see the -O0 option that I added, but afterwards -O2 coming from 
somewhere in R.  I believe the second one has precedence, because I see 
this in lldb:

   (lldb) p fontnames
   error: Couldn't materialize: couldn't get the value of variable 
fontnames: no location, value may have been optimized out

If I manually run the clang++ line after editing the -O2 to -O0 before 
rebuilding, I don't have this problem, but that's really tedious.

So, my question:  how should I be asking R CMD INSTALL to use -O0?

I use the following "hakish" solution: add in your Makevars something 
similar to:

MYFLAGS=-g -O0
%.o: %.cpp
 ?? ?$(CXX) $(ALL_CPPFLAGS) $(ALL_CXXFLAGS) $(MYFLAGS) -c $< -o $@
%.o: %.c
 ?? ?$(CC) $(ALL_CPPFLAGS) $(ALL_CFLAGS) $(MYFLAGS) -c $< -o $@
%.o: %.F
 ?? ?$(FC) $(ALL_FCFLAGS) $(MYFLAGS) -c $< -o $@

Best,
Serguei.

It seems to come from the CXXFLAGS macro defined in /etc/R/Makeconf.
It's the last to be added to ALL_CXXFLAGS, so you probably have to
overwrite it in ~/.R/Makevars.

The installer asks you

"Save Version in Registry" with Description "Save the R version and 
install path in the Registry". If this is checked in the installation 
wizard, it should work, otherwise not.

Hi Jonathan,

I'm not certain if this is the issue you're encountering, but I've
noticed that different versions of R may write to different locations
in the registry.

Right now, on my machine, I see entries for R 4.1.3 installed at:

    Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\R-core\R

And for my installation of R 4.2.1, I see it at:

    Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\R-core\R

Note that the registry location for R 4.2.1 is no longer part of the
WOW6432Node.

I'm not sure if this is a hiccup unique to my own local machine, but
perhaps you're seeing something similar? A way to verify would be to
check and compare what you see with:

    reg query HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\R-core\R /reg:32
    reg query HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\R-core\R /reg:64

In my case, I see:

C:\Users\kevin>reg query HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\R-core\R /reg:32

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\R-core\R
    InstallPath    REG_SZ    C:\R\R-4.1.3
    Current Version    REG_SZ    4.1.3

C:\Users\kevin>reg query HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\R-core\R /reg:64

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\R-core\R
    InstallPath    REG_SZ    C:\R\R-4.2.1
    Current Version    REG_SZ    4.2.1

Best,
Kevin

Thanks and I would like to define the follow-up actions: 

1) change function "writeURL" on line 207 to read, for example, url <- fsub("([%#&])", "\\\\1",  url) in https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/src/library/tools/R/Rd2latex.R <https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/src/library/tools/R/Rd2latex.R> to always escape URLs as you mention. 

How can this be moved forward? This seems R core code, thus needs to be reported in R Bugzilla by one of its members (I am not one): https://www.r-project.org/bugs.html#where-to-submit-bug-reports-and-patches <https://www.r-project.org/bugs.html#where-to-submit-bug-reports-and-patches>. 

Could someone from this list do this? Many thanks

2) change function "url_db_from_package_Rd_db" to call  ".get_urls_from_Rd" with parameter "ifdef = TRUE" on line 178 in https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/src/library/tools/R/urltools.R <https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/src/library/tools/R/urltools.R>. This will activate the existing code that is intended to handle ifdef{}{}{}. This seems important for the issue I have reported and beyond. Same procedure as above? 

3) change Rd.sty, not sure, 1) seems more relevant. 

Please advise, thanks 

Ralf

Jonathon,
Are you using a very old version of regdump?  Could it be a 32 bit
version?

Yes. I set both CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS in my Makevars_dbg0 file and let R 
use it via R_MAKEVARS_USER.
See R-Admin, 6.3.3, Customizing package compilation, for more.

In my case, the necessary settings needed to be put in CXX11FLAGS, 
because rgl defines CXX_STD = CXX11.  Thanks to Kevin Ushey and Prof. 
Brian Ripley for spotting this.

The R installer does not write R version information to the 32-bit view 
of the registry when installing only 64-bit files. This is the same with 
previous versions of R as can be seen from the code. I've tested with 
4.1.3 - when you opt out from installing 32-bit files, version 
information won't appear in the 32-bit view. In principle, one could 
still write something to the 32-bit view, though I think this decision 
was intentional as it required an extra condition in the sources.

R 4.2.x doesn't support 32-bit files anymore, hence? for users using the 
defaults, it is R 4.2.0 when the version information no longer appears 
in the 32-bit view.

One could proceed by searching both the 32-bit and the 64-bit views when 
looking for the newest installed version, preferring 64-bit. For 
practical use on current systems, using the 64-bit view only should 
probably do.

Best,
Tomas

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] No news entries found
Message-ID: <45a5fb16-f07e-7760-ed2e-bfe67a93946e@ineri.org>

Hi,

Today I have submitted a new version of the RALSA package. Soon after I 
received an automatic email letting me know that the package did not 
pass some of the pre-tests:

> package RALSA_1.3.0.tar.gz does not pass the incoming checks automatically, please see the following pre-tests:
> Windows:<https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/RALSA_1.3.0_20220707_190307/Windows/00check.log>
> Status: 2 NOTEs

> Status: 1 NOTE
>   
> Last released version's CRAN status: OK: 9, NOTE: 4
> See:<https://CRAN.R-project.org/web/checks/check_results_RALSA.html>

To summarize:

1. Windows checks found possibly invalid DOIs. This is to be ignored, as 
stated here: 
https://www.mail-archive.com/r-package-devel at r-project.org/msg07116.html

2. Windows, Debian (gcc) and Fedora (clang and gcc) drop the following note:

checking package subdirectories ... NOTE
Problems with news in 'NEWS.md':
No news entries found.

This is rather strange because I have added one of the largest news 
updates I ever made for this package in the NEWS.md file with this 
submission. Further, this note appears only in these four of the 13 
platforms where the package is checked.

Apparently, this is beyond my control and I can do nothing to fix it on 
my end. I have already replied to the email to notify the 
CRAN-submissions at R-project.org this is a false-positive as advised in 
the email itself, but I thought the mailing list should also be aware of 
this issue.

Best,
Plamen

A Bugzilla entry would have been nice for future reference but is no 
longer necessary. The Rd2latex() bug is now fixed in the development 
version of R (>= r82557) such that URLs with & or # characters can then 
also be used inside \tabular and give the same link as in the HTML 
version: \tabular{l}{\url{https://example.org/a&b#c}} should just work.
In other words, Rd2latex() now correctly handles the input URL as 
'verbatim' text (as specified in WRE Section 2.3), which also means that 
backslashes in the input that do not escape percent or braces (Rd 
specials) are preserved in the output (as was already the case for HTML).

It is planned to port the fix to R-patched (future R 4.2.2).

In package development I'd probably avoid such URLs inside \tabular 
until after that release. Otherwise, if you want to support building the 
PDF manual in current and future R, you'd need to use \out{} and do all 
the escaping there yourself, for example:

\name{test}
\title{test}
\description{
\tabular{l}{
    \ifelse{latex}{
      \out{\href{https://example.org/a\&b\#c}{link}}
    }{
      \href{https://example.org/a&b#c}{link}
    }
}
}

AFAICS, the below points are obsolete.

It would be helpful to let us know where to see the troublesome NEWS.md 
file.  Maybe a small change in formatting is causing these false positives.

)There's been recent updates in R-devel
(https://github.com/wch/r-source/commit/baf375d8b65414daebf85e226a1e5103a93ab138
that do more validation of the syntax/format in NEWS and NEWS.md
files. This was done to make sure news() works in more cases (e.g. it
may return just NULL if the NEWS.md file is not formatted as the tool
expect).  I guess it will also help render NEWS/NEWS.md files on the
CRAN package pages.

If you run,

news(package = "RALSA")

and see the NEWS entries, then the format should be correct, otherwise
not.  You can use:

news <- tools:::.build_news_db_from_package_NEWS_md("NEWS.md")
if (is.null(news)) stop("Syntax error in NEWS.md")

to troubleshoot.  If you get an error, i.e. 'news' is NULL, then you
need to fix up your NEWS.md file.  I don't think the format is
documented yet, so you might have to do some trial error to figure it
out.  Although it's not an official format, if you follow
https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/reference/build_news.html, it typically
works.  When I did it some weeks ago, I started with a minimal
NEWS.md, e.g. the top version, and then I added the other entries back
to find which ones were problematic.  See
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HenrikBengtsson/progressr/0.10.1/NEWS.md
for an example that works on CRAN
(https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/progressr/news/news.html) and
with news(package = "progressr").

Hope this helps,

Henrik

This is a new check in R-devel:
https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/commit/b1dce2cd3a59b80e870dc218dc668d90ff2a50fa
https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/commit/be94aacfbc62c211e765e00bcb9a4749d5be31c6

R can parse plain text and Markdown NEWS files and build news databases
out of those, but the files are expected to follow a certain format
documented in ?news. Do your headings look like "Changes in version
1.2-3 (2022-07-08)"? Try looking at the output of news(package =
'RALSA'), maybe it would tell you what R thinks is wrong with your
NEWS.md.

Ivan

Great, thanks -- 

using \out{} to wrap \href{} in .Rd for latex rendering does circumvent the issue that I reported, which is that .get_urls_from_Rd() is called such that it cannot handle \ifelse{} even though there is code in that R function for handling \ifelse{}.

The \out{} wrapper is useful, thanks. 

Not sure if the issue or the code is obsolete, but thanks again and happy to close this thread. 

Best,
Ralf

Thank you all for your help.

I have found the problem - I had accented characters in names of people 
I was thanking for discovering bugs. After replacing them with 
non-accented characters everything went just fine and the package is on 
its way to CRAN.

I do find, though, the message "No news entries found." quite 
misleading. Yes, there is a problem, but the message is not even close 
to what actual the problem is. Unfortunately, the r-svn repository on 
GitHub does not have the possibility to report this as an issue.

Thank you once again.

Best,
Plamen

Good you figured it out. If you can share a minimal NEWS.md illustrating
the problem here, it'll probably help lots of others who run into the same
problem. It might even be bug that your have discovered, but without
details no one can improve on it.

I can reproduce slowdown in one of your tests:

library(mkin)
FOCUS_D <- subset(FOCUS_2006_D, value != 0)
SFO_SFO <- mkinmod(
 ? parent = mkinsub("SFO", "m1"),
 ? m1 = mkinsub("SFO"))
FOMC_SFO <- mkinmod(
 ? parent = mkinsub("FOMC", "m1"),
 ? m1 = mkinsub("SFO"))
DFOP_SFO <- mkinmod(
 ? parent = mkinsub("FOMC", "m1"),
 ? m1 = mkinsub("SFO"))

mmkin_bench <- function(models, datasets, error_model = "const") {
 ? mmkin(models, datasets, error_model = error_model, cores = 1, quiet = 
TRUE)
}

t4 <- system.time(mmkin_bench(list(SFO_SFO, FOMC_SFO, DFOP_SFO), 
list(FOCUS_D), error_model = "tc"))[["elapsed"]]

This is slower in R 4-devel than R 4.1 because of bug fixes in DLL info 
interface (PR#16446, r80285). "perf" tool on Linux shows extra time 
spent in R_registerSymbolEptr and R_WeakRefKey. This is because of 
repeated calls to getLoadedDLLs(), via repeated calls to 
inline::getDynLib(x$cf)[["name"]]

Perhaps one could save dll_info, once computed in mkin, alongside "cf" 
in the model, instead of re-computing it every time?

Please see  https://bugs.r-project.org/    but also see old mailing list (and
elsewhere) posts on how to create a bugzilla account for which you need a human.

The R FAQ is also there for you:

  9.2 How to report a bug
      https://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#How-to-report-a-bug

which could arguably do with a paragraph on how to get a bugzilla account ...

Yes, here is an excerpt from the NEWS.md with a problematic case at the end:

#######################################################

# RALSA v1.3.0 (2022-07-08)

This update focuses mainly on bugfixes and improvements in the GUI and 
its workflow, but also introduces some new features.

## Bug fixes
* All analysis functions, as well `lsa.data.diag`, `lsa.recode.vars` and 
`lsa.vars.dict` crash with an error message `Error in 
exists(all.vars(match.call())) : first argument has length > 1` when any 
of the arguments specifying analysis variables point to objects which 
contain character vectors containing them. Thanks to Rodolfo Ilizaliturri.

* `lsa.prctls` - The percentiles on the x-axis are not properly added 
for every percentile computed. Thanks to Someone ?ome?ne.

#######################################################

If I remove the accented characters at the very last word, it all works 
fine when the package is submitted at CRAN.

Best,
Plamen

Interesting. The "No news entries found." branch is taken by R CMD
check in case when the news-reading function returns something that
doesn't inherit from 'news_db' or has zero rows without producing any
warning or error messages. Yet if I save this excerpt to a file and
feed it to tools:::.build_news_db_from_package_NEWS_md, I get a valid
news_db object. Can you see any difference in its output between the
NEWS.md that causes a NOTE and the one that doesn't?

Dear all,

I want to compute processing functions to apply to the data.
I apply the functions to the data in a second step.
proc_0 increases the memory, proc_1 is safe.
reprex below.

If this behavior is known, could you tell me a workaround before I try 
to guess the best one?

I accidentally replied privately to this message.  Here is the reply 
that I intended to send to the list, along with an addition based on 
Samuel's reply to me.

When a function is called, it creates an environment that holds the
arguments and all local variables.  If the function returns that
environment, or a value that references it, all the local variables will
still be there.

In your function I believe the anonymous functions you create in `model`
are catching the environment.  Since those functions are created as part
of the evaluation of proc_0, each of them will have the evaluation
environment attached.

NEW addition:  In R, functions have an associated environment set as the 
parent of the evaluation environment mentioned above.  Those are called 
"the environment of the function", and can be retrieved from function fn 
using `environment(fn)`.  For top-level functions like proc_0, 
environment(proc_0) would be the global environment, but for functions 
created within another function, it would be the evaluation environment 
active at the time of creation.

Your code has

   sapply(cofactors, function(cofactor) function(z) z / cofactor)

This creates the function with definition

   function(cofactor) function(z) z / cofactor

The environment of that function will be the evaluation environment of 
proc_0.  When that function is called by sapply(), it will create an 
evaluation environment holding cofactor, and that environment will be 
used by the function returned, i.e. the result of

   function(z) z / cofactor

So you'll end up with this chain of environments:

   environment(function(z) z / cofactor) is the evaluation environment 
of function(cofactor) function(z) z / cofactor;

   its parent is the evaluation environment of proc_0, containing dat;

   its parent is environment(proc_0), which is the global environment.

The global environment isn't captured, but the others are, so you save a 
copy of dat every time you call proc_0.

But none of those functions need access to dat, so there's no need to 
keep it, and after your last use of it in proc_0, just run rm(dat) to 
get rid of it.

OLD part again:

By the way, mem_used() isn't a great way to measure memory use, because
it will count things that will be cleaned up in a future garbage
collection.  When I added "rm(dat)" to your function, I saw this:

  > a = new("fb")
  > a at d = sample(rnorm(1e7))
  > a at f = list()
  > mem_used()
363 MB
  > b = proc_0(a)
  > mem_used()
283 MB

i.e. *less* memory was used after b was created, presumably because a gc
happened.

It's better to use object.size() or pryr::object_size() to measure the
size of individual objects.  Neither one is perfect: they use different
rules to decide what to include, and in some cases, memory used in one
object is counted again as part of another.  The way R allocated memory
means there is *no* perfect definition of the size of an object.

This may be misleading.  The reference to the global environment will be 
there; what I meant is that there's no extra copy of the global 
environment.  If we didn't have the references in the chain above, the 
evaluation environments would all have been garbage collected after 
proc_0 finished, but because we still have references to them, they are 
"captured", so we keep a copy until those references go away when the 
result of the proc_0 call is deleted.

Great answer. I think I missed the point on the parent environment 
although I did my best to care about the environment.

Message-ID: <d2a61bd8-1b87-a2b2-8f24-14ba72b9e6f0@mcmaster.ca>

   For some stupid reason I agreed to take over maintenance of the 
now-orphaned `gtools` package ("how much trouble could that be, after 
all?"), which has 203 strong reverse dependencies.

   CRAN is reporting that exactly **one** of them, dnapath, is
failing reverse dependency checks ("changed to worse").

   I am having trouble replicating this (I'm running R-devel, can't 
install bioconductor packages on R-devel, working on doing everything in 
a Docker container, blah blah blah ...)

   In any case I am mystified as to how my new version of the package 
could be breaking something in the downstream package, since AFAICT the 
*only* functionality that `dnapath` is using from gtools is `permute()`, 
which is (1) a one-line wrapper for sample() and (2) hasn't changed in 
many years.

    I will try to figure out how much more time to invest in this rabbit 
hole before continuing the conversation with the CRAN maintainers, but 
in the meantime any insights or advice would be welcome.

   The problem is in vignette rebuilding, errors of this form in both of 
the package vignettes:

   Can't join on `x$entrezgene_id` x `y$entrezgene_id` because of
   incompatible types.
   ? `x$entrezgene_id` is of type <double>>.
   ? `y$entrezgene_id` is of type <character>>.

Thank you, I contacted R-Bugzilla to create an account for me, 
explaining the reason. The answer was that this is related with CRAN 
incoming packages' checks which does not mean it is an R bug which is to 
be reported and that the CRAN checks are performed using R-devel 
version, not the released, so it is not a bug that shall be reported.

I actually agree with the answer, especially given that the issue I 
encountered was with four out of the 10 platforms where the package was 
checked and not all, so I don't really think it is an R-bug that should 
be reported to R-Bugzilla.

I'd hazard a guess that both vignettes crash in a call to
entrez_to_symbol (a direct one or via rename_genes). Specifically, its
first argument (`x`) is converted to numeric, then the following
happens:

    df <- data.frame(entrezgene_id = x)
    df <- dplyr::left_join(df, gene_info, by = "entrezgene_id")

gene_info is obtained above, using the following:

  gene_info <- get_biomart_mapping(species, symbol_name, dir_save,
                                   verbose) %>%
    dplyr::group_by(entrezgene_id) %>%
    dplyr::summarise(dplyr::across(dplyr::everything(), dplyr::first))

get_biomart_mapping accesses the Internet using biomaRt::getBM if it
can, but otherwise uses a copy of the information for human genome
cached inside the package.

There doesn't seem to be any mention of special cases for
"entrezgene_id" in the code of the biomaRt package. biomaRt::getBM
POSTs XML queries to ensembl.org/biomart/martservice?... and parses the
resulting tab-separated values using read.table.

My guess is, ensembl.org started returning something that isn't a
number in the entrezgene_id column, and you were the first one to
rebuild the vignette and notice that.

Is the reason my package failed because the functions assign global

should not assign global variables?

Namespaces are sealed after loading. Workaround is to create a global variable that is an environment in an `.onLoad` hook, and modify variables in that environment instead.

It's in the CRAN repository policy:

"- Packages should not modify the global environment (user?s workspace)."

Thanks for taking over an orphaned package.  Not an easy task!

I think that dnapath is calling `gtools::permutations` from
`dnapath.R` around lines 339-343 [1], not `gtools::permute`.

Changes to  the file `combinations.R` in `gtools` where `permutations`
resides were made in June 2021 [2].

I could not find an obvious place where the join above is happening in
the vignette, unfortunately, so I can't be of more help than just
pointing you in a different direction.

Submitted package 'fGarch' has been stuck in CRAN 'pretest' for about 24 hours now. The same seems to hold for several other packages. Is this something that can be expected normally?

The pretest service seems to work normally in that other packages come and go.

My guess is it is because of a problem in R-devel, the development 
version of R, which has been fixed/reverted but it may take some time 
for systems to recover (82587+82589, the former tested on 
CRAN/Bioconductor packages, the latter being a hot-fix of the former, 
which unfortunately made a very large number of CRAN packages to fail). 
It is part of an attempt to fix semantics of useBytes=TRUE ([1] is 
somewhat related). Sorry for the inconvenience.

I have not had the time to look into the details of the stuck packages, 
but Tomas explanation is most likely true, as both the recheck systems 
maintained by Kurt and also my winbuilder platform have packages stuck 
in the queues.
Please be patient, we try to fix this soon.

Best,
Uwe

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Fwd: cmake based compilation works on macOS but fails
 on Linux machines

Hi everyone

I am trying to compile a package which provides an interface to the Ceres
solver <http://ceres-solver.org/> C++ library for large-scale,
unconstrained optimization. The requirements for compiling this library are
non-trivial and I am using cmake based compilation into static libraries,
following the steps in the excellent nloptr package
<https://github.com/astamm/nloptr>

The package code can be found here <https://github.com/sn248/ceres>

The package requires Eigen
<https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page>, gflags
<https://gflags.github.io/gflags/> and glog <https://github.com/google/glog>
as requirements and they are all compiled from source before compiling
ceres from source using cmake. The package successfully compiles and I am
able to run the helloworld example in the library on my macOS (10.15.7),
see the example on the github page <https://github.com/sn248/ceres>. I am
also able to compile on rhub's mac OS machines (i.e., macOS 10.13.6 High
Sierra, R-release, brew AND macOS 10.13.6 High Sierra, R-release, CRAN's
setup). However, _exactly_ the same package fails to compile on Ubuntu and
Debian machines on rhub.

In summary,

Case 1 - When my Makevars is the following, the package compiles
successfully on my local macOS and rhub's macOS (all except Apple Silicon,
M1).

CXX_STD = CXX17
> PKG_CPPFLAGS = -I../inst/include
> PKG_LDFLAGS = ../inst/
> PKG_LIBS = $(LAPACK_LIBS) $(BLAS_LIBS) $(FLIBS) -L$(PKG_LDFLAGS)
> ../inst/libceres.a ../inst/libgflags.a ../inst/libgflags_nothreads.a
> ../inst/libglog.a


But I get the following error on Linux machines (e.g., Debian Linux,
R-devel, GCC)

Error: package or namespace load failed for 'ceres' in dyn.load(file,
> DLLpath = DLLpath, ...):
>  unable to load shared object

Case 2 - When my Makevars is the following, I get error shown below on my
local machine (macOS 10.15.7)

CXX_STD = CXX17

I am thinking this is because of the fact that glog has the default cmake
option of being built as a shared library (although a static library can
also be built and is being built in the package).  However, I don't know
how I can link the shared library libglog.dylib.

To make the matters more interesting, if I install the packages on an
Ubuntu system (i.e., rocker/rstudio <https://rocker-project.org/images/>
with system installs of Eigen, glog and gflags), the package compiles
successfully with Makevars as in Case 2.

I would be very thankful if any help/pointers can be provided to compile
the package on Linux machines. Additionally, it seems on Apple Mac (M1) and
Solaris machines the compilation of package fails due to cmake
non-availability, how can I compile on those platforms?

Thanks
Satya

We have asked for an update fixing the check problems shown at

with no update from the maintainer thus far.

Thus, package Ecfun is now scheduled for archival on 2022-08-08, and
archiving this will necessitate also archiving its CRAN strong reverse

Please see 
https://blog.r-project.org/2022/06/27/why-to-avoid-%5Cx-in-regular-expressions

Looking at the code I guess you should change the strings in icx to use 
\u escapes instead of \x. The use of \x as it is there was probably 
correct when the code was ran in Latin-1 encoding, but not in other 
encodings. Using \u would make it portable. Feel free to ask more if my 
guess is wrong and reading the blog post doesn't help.

Best
Tomas

	  "subNonStandardCharacters.Rd" copies examples from:


https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/iconv


	  This file still contains "\x" in 5 places.  What's the recommended 
fix?  Replace "\x" with "\u00" everyplace?


	  I could try that, but I don't know if I have access to platforms that 
would tell me if I fixed it or not ;-)


	  Thanks very much.

Have you tried changing the \x's in that file with \u's?

(charToRaw shows that qu and qx are not byte-for-byte identical: '=='
coerces the latin1 strings to utf-8.)

I have not tried anything yet for three reasons:


	  1.  I don't know that I have access to anything that can do the 
proper test that's required, so I can know if I've fixed it or not.


	  2.  Tomas' blog included examples that seemed to say to replace 
"\xa0" with "\u00a0", NOT "\ua0", and I don't know if this difference 
matters or not.


	  3.  Can someone provide me with a link to the correct development 
version of help('iconv')?  The current version includes the exact 
offending "\x" strings that I have.  If I know the fix in the correct 
development version of help('iconv'), I can copy that.  Without that, 
I'm being asked to correct something that may not have been corrected in 
the development version of the base package.


	  Thanks,
	  Spencer

Adding the initial zeroes is a bit safer, as would be \u{df}; either
protects against the next character being a hex digit.  There are 6 byte
utf-8 'characters', but I don't think R's parser accepts more than 4.

 ?The help pages are at

https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/trunk/src/library/base/man/iconv.Rd

or the equivalent at https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn

or https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/src/library/base/man/iconv.Rd

 ? they still have \x examples in them, but maybe the use of \x is not 
flagged in the particular context of those examples?

	  Thanks.  Tomas' blog was good in documenting the need and some of the 
pitfalls, but I don't know the difference between "\ua0", "\u00a0", 
"\u{a0}" or anything else, and I don't know how to find documentation 
that would explain that.  As I wrote years ago, it's hard to RTFM if I 
don't know which FMTR ;-)


	  Most important, I think for my current issue:  How can I find the 
correct development version of help('iconv')?


	  Since I copied the example used in subNonStandardCharacters.Rd from 
help('iconv'), I should be fine if I do what the R Core Team did with 
help('iconv').  Or if I guess and guess wrong, I could get another email 
from Prof Brian Ripley, ordering me to fix something.  I could search 
myself for the current development version of the base package, but I'm 
not sure I'd know if I got the correct version and not some other 
experiment that is different from the actual official development version.

http://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/src/library/base/man/iconv.Rd

It still does, because it works with byte strings the right way: by
passing them to iconv(), which is designed to work with bytes in
"unknown" encodings.

In contrast, your use of arbitrary bytes with gsub() is invalid,
because gsub() assumes that the strings match their declared encoding:
UTF-8, Latin-1, or the native locale encoding. (See ?Encoding.)

When you write "Ekstr\xf8m", you get a string that consists of Latin-1
bytes but has the wrong encoding property set. Given this string,
gsub() and friends will break on a UTF-8 system (because "r\xf8m" is
not a valid UTF-8 sequence of bytes), while iconv() will not.

Depending on the desired semantics of subNonStandardCharacters(), you
might be able to avoid the failures with the useBytes argument, or you
might silently return invalid data in some corner cases. Is the "x"
argument supposed to be bytes in arbitrary encoding, or properly decoded
characters that might include those that don't map to ASCII?

	  Wow.  So what's the recommended fix?


	  If I understand correctly, "\u**" should work with ** being f8, f6, 
df, or fc [all hex digits, I assume?].  However, "\u00**" may be 
preferred over "\u**", and "\u{**}" may be better still.


	  The blog that Tomas wrote might be more useful if it included a 
recommendation like this.


	  Thanks for all your work to make R better and thereby help people 
everywhere extract better information from the data available to them.


	  Spencer

Perhaps look at [1]? iconv is trying to handle conformity with the Unicode standard, so try starting out by assuming it will succeed.

Meanwhile, you should consider using a docker container to test your code in an environment similar to to the ones throwing errors. [2] Or just make the change and resubmit.

Tomas' blog was good in documenting the need and some of the pitfalls, but I don't know the difference between "\ua0", "\u00a0", "\u{a0}" or anything else, and I don't know how to find documentation that would explain that.  As I wrote years ago, it's hard to RTFM if I don't know which FMTR ;-)

Or if I guess and guess wrong, I could get another email from Prof Brian Ripley, ordering me to fix something.  I could search myself for the current development version of the base package, but I'm not sure I'd know if I got the correct version and not some other experiment that is different from the actual official development version.

That's all correct.

I think that advice is too specific to this example.  Here's a short 
explanation about what's going on:

Strings in R are assumed to be in the ASCII encoding if they have no 
bytes bigger than 128 (hex 80).

If they do have such bytes, they can be marked as "latin1", or "UTF-8", 
or not marked, in which case they are assumed to be in the local encoding.

If you write a string containing "\u....", it is marked as being in the 
"utf8" encoding.

If you write a string containing "\x....", it is not marked.

Thus if you are writing strings for others to use, you don't know how 
those strings will be interpreted unless you explicitly set their 
encoding.  For example, this is ambiguous:

    x <- "fa\xE7ile"

This is not:

    x <- "fa\xE7ile"
    Encoding(x) <- "latin1"

The advice you received to change the \x to \u works for your examples, 
but might fail in other examples.  As help("Quotes") says, "\uE7" is the 
Unicode code point hex E7, which is a c with a cedilla.  (The two hex 
digit Unicode values from 80 to FF match the Latin-1 values; but not 
everyone lives and works in a Latin-1 locale, so \xE7 might not be 
equivalent to \uE7 for some people.)

You can have 1-4 hex digits after \u.  If the next character happens to 
be a hex digit, you'll get some other character, e.g. "\uE7" is a ? (a c 
with a cedilla), but "\uE7a" is a single Thai character, and "\uE7ab" is 
some other single character (in the "private use area" of Unicode).

So it's safest to use exactly 4 hex digits as \u00E7, or to wrap the 
value in curly braces, \u{E7}.

Some Unicode characters need more than 4 hex digits.  Use \U for those.

Is subNonStandardCharacters() supposed to work with strings with
Encoding(.) == 'unknown' that are also invalid in current locale
encoding? (I think it's fair to not support Encoding(.) == 'bytes' for
such a function, because such strings aren't supposed to be text.)

If yes, the function itself needs to be fixed. I think that
useBytes=TRUE may help, as long as the standardCharacters argument is
limited to characters representable in ASCII. Alternatively, find a way
to transform the 'x' argument into something that is guaranteed to be
valid in its declared encoding. enc2utf8() could be an option, but any
invalid bytes are replaced by their <hexadecimal codes>, which defeats
the purpose of subNonStandardCharacters(). Find a way to feed the
output of Encoding(x) to iconv() as its "from" argument?

If not, it's enough to fix the example.

This is described in ?Quotes, although admittedly harder to find than
desired. The "\u" escape sequences take 1 to 4 hexadecimal digits. As
long as your escape sequence isn't followed by something that looks
like a hexadecimal digit, you can keep it short, like "\uf8m" (m is not
a hex digit). If you want to be 100% unambiguous, either padding the
code point number to 4 digits ("\u00f8m") or wrapping it into braces
("\u{f8}m") is enough. The belt-and-bracers approach ("\u{00f8}m") is
not an error, either.

You can also use the Encoding(x) <- 'latin1' trick to mark the strings
produced from bytes as Latin-1. Then gsub() will work normally, the
same way things happily work in example(iconv).

Thanks to all who replied.  I've changed all the "\x.." to "\u{..}".  I 
have other issues to deal with, but this seems to answer this question. 
  Thanks again, Spencer Graves

Hi Spencer,

This NOTE was discussed a couple weeks ago on this list, it's (as you may expect) a new check in R-devel. Here's what Ivan had to say: https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-package-devel/2022q3/008239.html

Others also chimed in, you can see the first message of the thread here: https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-package-devel/2022q3/008235.html

Good luck!

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] CRAN pre-test failure due to long runtime / timeout
Message-ID: <cce163c9-5ef2-96e2-8127-c0aa2efc8b81@jonaskurle.com>

Dear all,

I submitted a new version of my package "robust2sls" (released version 
on CRAN <https://cran.r-project.org/package=robust2sls>, new submitted 
version on GitHub <https://github.com/jkurle/robust2sls>).

The automatic CRAN pre-tests fail and it seems that this is due to 
runtime timeout (in the tests). For Windows, I get the message "Check 
process probably crashed or hung up for 20 minutes ... killed" and for 
Debian, I get "checking tests ... [30m/30m] ERROR". See below for the 
links to the log files.

https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/robust2sls_0.2.1_20220722_180126/Windows/00check.log
https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/robust2sls_0.2.1_20220722_180126/Debian/00check.log 


It seems that the development version of R might be causing this 
problem, and others have already discussed longer running times of their 
checks on this mailing list.

If I do the checks on winbuilder using the old version 
<https://win-builder.r-project.org/VCReLD0u8Svj/00check.log> or release 
version <https://win-builder.r-project.org/l0zOMEvibJ1b/00check.log> of 
R, it works fine. But with the development version 
<https://win-builder.r-project.org/5ZebbySXV99X/00check.log> it fails.

Surprisingly, the CRAN checks work well on all five settings that I have 
tried with GitHub Actions 
<https://github.com/jkurle/robust2sls/actions/runs/2719662067>, 
including the one with the development version of R on Ubuntu. The check 
took less than 10 minutes in this case.

Can anyone advise me what to do? I could skip most of my tests based on 
the "testthat" package to decrease the runtime, such that they can 
finish when re-submitting to CRAN even if the development version of R 
is slower. But of course, I would prefer to keep my tests and figure out 
the reason for the slowdown.

Thank you for any suggestions and help!

Best wishes,
Jonas

There is a "fix" addressing the _symptom_ but not the _cause_: simply do not
run the tests. Your time is finite, CRAN maintainer time is certainly finite.
Even today we still do not have a real ability to cleanly reproduce CRAN
checks (win-builder is pretty close, but eg CRAN Debian is not Dockerized and
hence not really reproducible (I once offered help but this petered out
without generating anything tangible).

This topic has been discussed a few times before. Some people advocate using
skip_on_cran() (if you use testthat). I don't testthat but in some packages
only run tests if an env. var is set which I set eg for GitHUb Actions.

Hth, Dirk

I see you're using testthat. Is there a way to make it produce verbose
output for every test during their runtime? As far as I know, testthat
tests look like a single test to R CMD check which only outputs
everything after it's done (or an error occurs). Since the R process is
terminated on timeout, it doesn't get a chance to handle an error and
print anything.

One way I see is relatively time-consuming, but so is blindly playing
skip_on_cran with individual tests and resubmitting jobs to
win-builder. If you move your tests from tests/testthat/*.R into
tests/*.R (and adjust them to work outside the testthat harness if
necessary), R should be able to tell you which *.R file times out
and show you the approximate location where it was terminated.

Alternatively, you could try instrumenting your tests with debugging
print commands and see if any of them end up in 00check.log, but I
think that testthat uses capture.output to declutter the console when
running tests, which, sadly, ends up interfering with your ability to
debug the problem in this case.

Dear Ivan and Dirk,

Thank you both for your suggestions and your help.

For now, I will simply skip the automatic unit testing on CRAN. My 
submission to winbuilder is now successful for all versions of R.

In the long run, I might move away from testthat to have more 
flexibility with respect to debugging and being able to see in more 
detail what is going on. I also received a hint from another user 
(thanks Johannes!) who ran my tests locally on their Debian system, 
where the tests did not time out but eventually produced an error. It 
turns out that some of my tests / functions work slightly differently on 
different platforms, so I can now adjust these tests to be 
platform-specific.

Thanks again and best wishes,
Jonas

Hello, All:


	  Thanks to Uwe Ligges, Max Turgeon, Duncan Murdoch, Ivan Krylov, Jeff 
Newmiller, Ben Bolker, Bill Dunlap, and Tomas Kalibera, Ecfun 0.3-0 is 
now available on CRAN, after three earlier versions were rejected in 
three days due to my limited ability to understand the error messages I 
saw.


	  My excuse for being so dense is that all the problems I encountered 
were changes required to meet new, more stringent standards implemented 
to reduce ambiguity and tighten coding standards to convert more subtle, 
intermittent problems that are difficult to trace into coding errors 
that are more easily fixed.

Hi,

Recently I got the following email from the CRAN maintainer about my
package, string2path[1].

However, I do ensure the binary is the pinned version and verify if the
hash matches with the embedded one in the DESCRIPTION [2][3]. In case of a
mismatch, the build fails. So, this mechanism should ensure that I (or
anyone) cannot change the version of the binary without actually
resubmitting to CRAN.

I believe this complies with the CRAN policy (except for not clearing the
authorship and copyright). Is there anything I have to address to prove I
do "ensure that the download is of a fixed version"? Any suggestions are
welcome.

The CRAN policy stipulates

Please see the policy cited. Ensuring that the download is of a fixed 
version refers to the sources (which can be downloaded under the 
conditions mentioned).

Downloading binaries are only a last resort option and requires the

My understanding from your email is you are ensuring a fixed version 
download, and with most projects you could probably do even less (simply 
hardcode a URL which includes a specific version of the sources if that 
is stable for the project), but you are not downloading sources.

In either case, of course if there is anything unclear in an email from 
CRAN, you can simply respond to that and ask.

Thank you. I'll read the policy again more carefully.

> but you are not downloading sources.

The case is that, I include the Rust source code, but since the CRAN's
Windows & macOS machines don't have the Rust compiler installed, there's no
choice but to download the pre-compiled binary (other than downloading the
Rust compiler).

Thanks, I already responded with what I wrote above, so I hope I can get
the reply.
But, since the CRAN team might be on vacation now, I wanted to get some
advice on this mailing list.
Thanks for your help!

I'd say at least check whether the compiler is present (during package 
installation), and use it if it is. Only if you want to download 
binaries as a last resort when it isn't, consult that first with the 
CRAN team. Perhaps it could also be a hard dependency for installing the 
package, and perhaps Rust compiler would be installed on the CRAN machines.

I think it is better not to hard-code which software is installed on the 
CRAN systems, because that may change and because different software may 
be installed on user machines. However, on Windows, it is ok to expect 
that say Rtools42 is available when building packages for R 4.2 (yet 
Rtools42 don't have a rust compiler, so it doesn't help you here).

Right, downloading the source code of the Rust compiler and building it 
seems a bit too resource intensive and then, a bit too much if multiple 
R packages need it. Ideally the compiler will be installed and the R 
source packages will really be source packages (no binaries).

I take back the comment about doing less to ensure a fixed version - it 
is good to use a hash always when having to download sources, as 
software distributions do (of course including MXE and Msys2, so Rtools 
on Windows, etc). It is better as a guard against that the content is in 
fact not stable for the project (I've been told it sometimes happens and 
may be surprising to package authors), but of course also for security 
reasons.

Hi,

Thank you so much Tomas for helping me to figure out the things. Let me
share some updates (some of them are what you've seen already in the reply
to the CRAN maintainer) in case this might be eventually useful to those
who are curious about using Rust on CRAN.

First of all, let me correct my misunderstanding. I thought what violates
the CRAN policy was that my package downloads a binary, but in actual, it
seems my fault was

    1. if the compiler exists, my package downloads the **sources** of the
dependency, whose authorships are not described.
    2. if the compiler doesn't exist, my package downloads the pre-compiled
binary **without the agreement of the CRAN team**

For point 2, as suggested in the previous comment,

> at least check whether the compiler is present (during package
installation), and use it if it is.

my package first checks if Cargo, Rust's compiler toolchain and package
manager, is installed (more specifically, whether the `cargo` command can
be found on PATH), and falls back to downloading the pre-compiled binary
only when Cargo is not available. So, I believe this can be considered as
"a last resort". Again, it was clearly my fault that I didn't ask the CRAN
maintainers for permission on my first submission.

However, it seems Cargo is already available on the following CRAN machines:

    - Linux machines
    - Windows Server 2022 (at least on winbuilder. Thanks David B. Dahl for
the information!)
    - M1 macOS machine (guessed from the comment from the CRAN maintainer)

If I remember correctly, the Windows machine didn't have Cargo installed
when I submitted my package to CRAN. I'd really appreciate the CRAN
maintainers' effort to improve the infrastructure, and I hope Cargo will be
available on Intel macOS machines in the not so distant future so that I no
longer need to provide the pre-compiled binary (I'm not sure if I can have
the same hope on the Windows 2008, which might be a bit too old to install
some latest-ish version of Cargo, though [2]).


For point 1, it's Cargo that downloads the sources. It does download the
fixed versions recorded in the bundled "Cargo.lock" file, and verifies the
checksum. While Cargo provides the vendoring mechanism [1], I thought it
was not realistic to include the sources because my dependency was so huge
(132MB). But, I was wrong at two points.

First, no matter whether to download or to bundle the sources, the CRAN
Policy requires to describe the copyright information of "all components of
the package," which should refer to all the individual Rust crate in the
context of my package.

>  The ownership of copyright and intellectual property rights of all
components of the package must be clear and unambiguous (including from the
authors specification in the DESCRIPTION file). Where code is copied (or
derived) from the work of others (including from R itself), care must be
taken that any copyright/license statements are preserved and authorship is
not misrepresented.

Second, it was possible to reduce the size to the extent where I can bundle
it. I could tweak some libraries to drop the heavy dependency, and compress
the source code (again, thanks David B. Dahl for the idea).

I'm yet to figure out what's the proper way to list up the authors (I'm
currently using inst/COPYRIGHTS, but I'm not fully sure at the moment), but
I'm working on tweaking my package to bundle all the sources and to clarify
the authorships of these dependencies [2]. I hope this will keep my package
on CRAN.

Best,
Yutani

[2]: Actually, it keeps failing on Windows Server 2008 with the
pre-compiled binary probably due to lack of some system API:

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] cran submission check produces note on news file
Message-ID: <CAD7xazv8Y9uQPaRJeiwyusByCQQJwxtCCwdDFe-5Dc=oghYUdA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am the creator and maintainer of package lefko3, which creates matrix
projections for use in population ecology. I just submitted a version of
this package to CRAN, and got a Note on the debian check that showed that
it could not process the NEWS file. All other system pretests (including
Windows and MAC) were fine, and my own checks on Mac, Ubuntu, and Windows
had no such issues. I have looked through the CRAN documentation seeing if
there is any formatting issue, but I cannot find any problems. Can anyone
provide any help?

Here is a link to my R Forge site holding the NEWS file itself:

https://r-forge.r-project.org/scm/viewvc.php/pkg/?root=lefko3

The check log from the pretest is here:

https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/lefko3_5.4.1_20220805_235501/Debian/00check.log

The particular Note that appears to have failed CRANs prechecks is the
following:

Flavor: r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-gcc

          1. Function actualstage3() has been rewritten in C++ to handle
all stage,
             age-by-stage, and age inputs. Can now remove stages as
necessary, and
             allows different stages to be removed in times t1 and t2 in
historical
             stage pair assessments.
          2. Function hist_null() can now produce historically-formatted
ahistorical
             matrices that do not include impossible transitions.

failure in
             sparse matrices.
          4. Reference matrix warnings in ltre3() have been corrected.
    Cannot process chunk/lines:
      CHANGES IN VERSION 5.3.0 (2022-06-24)
        NEW FEATURES
          1. Function actualstage3() now also outputs proportions of ages
and age-
             stages within hfv datasets.
          2. Function vrm_import() created to allow IPM and other
function-based model
             slope coefficients can now be imported directly without
conducting linear
             model searches through modelsearch().
          3. Functions flefko3(), flefko2(), aflefko2(), fleslie(), and
             f_projection3() have been updated to allow the use of
vrm_input objects,
             allowing slope coefficients to be imported directly.
          4. Function hfv_qc() developed to test hfv datasets for quality
control
             using the same parameterizations and subsetting strategies
used in
             function modelsearch().
        USER-VISIBLE CHANGES
          1. Function create_pm() can now yield paramnames objects with
default
             model variable names used instead of "none" strings.
          2. Vignettes updated with new functions. Particularly, material
for
             sf_distrib() replaced with material for hfv_qc().
          3. Tweaks and corrections to help files.
        BUG FIXES
          1. Fixed bug causing substochasticity setting 2 in functions
projection3()
             and f_projection3() to yield negative survival probabilities
under some
             circumstances in which survival column sums totaled more than
1.0.
          2. Fix bug omitting substochasticity correction in fecundity
under some
             conditions when function f_projection3() is run with substoch
= 2.
    Cannot process chunk/lines:
      CHANGES IN VERSION 5.2.0 (2022-05-18)
        NEW FEATURES
          1. Function f_projection3() can now run density dependent
projections in
             which the vital rates used are modified by projected density.
          2. Function density_vr() created to provide vital rate density
dependence
             information for function f_projection3().
          3. Option added to functions projection3() and f_projection3() to
suppress
             warnings.
          4. Function summary.lefkoProj() now has an option to interpret
NaN values as
             positive infinity, changing the count of replicates still
alive in the
             milepost section. This option, inf_alive, may also be set to
FALSE to
             count NaNs as evidence of extinction.
          5. A new summary_hfv() function has been created to simplify
quality
             control checks on historical vertical format datasets.
          6. Function verticalize3() now warns the user to check the
resulting dataset
             if the dataset is censored and the blocksize option is used
without
             the censorRepeat option being set to TRUE, as these cases may
result in
             excessive data pruning.
          7. Function summary.lefkoProj() now calculates mean extinction
time when
             prompted.
        USER-VISIBLE CHANGES
          1. Function modelsearch() now allows an "age" setting for the
suite option,
             which yields the same results as "cons" but checks to make
sure that an
             age variable is properly added.
          2. Function modelsearch() now allows a "leslie" setting for the
vitalrates
             option, which provides a shorthand for c("surv", "fec") as
would be used
             by fleslie().
          3. The documentation for functions modelsearch() and fleslie()
have been
             updated to provide more information for handling Leslie MPMs.
          4. Added series of new error messages if expected data frame size
input in
             verticalize3() is too large.
          5. Vignettes have been updated with new functions.
          6. Some error messages made more informative.
        BUG FIXES
          1. The stageframe developed with functions rleslie() and
fleslie() has been
             fixed to include stage_id, alive, and almost_born variables,
allowing
             Leslie-formatted lefkoMat objects to be passed to all lefko3
functions
             analyzing them, including lmean().
          2. Fixed bug yielding vector leaks from other variables when
using the
             blocksize feature in verticalize3().
          3. Fixed incorrect fecundity summation in rlefko3(), resulting
from
             miscounting offspring from individuals dying the transition in
which they
             reproduced.
    Cannot process chunk/lines:
      CHANGES IN VERSION 5.1.0 (2022-04-01)
        NEW FEATURES
          1. Added ability to run ordered annual matrix progressions in
function
             projection3().

        USER-VISIBLE CHANGES
          1. Added cancel handling to verticalize3(), historicalize3(),
slambda3(),
             sensitivity3(), elasticity3(), and ltre3().
          2. Added transitions to some supplemental() in function examples
and
             vignettes, reflecting more exact transition specification.
        BUG FIXES
          1. Fixed incorrect substochastic correction in projection3() and
             f_projection3() when substoch = 2 and negative survival
entries occur.
          2. Cleaned up minor memory issues in some functions.
          3. Corrected class lefkoProj structure output by function
f_projection3()
             to correspond exactly to that produced by function
projection3().
          4. Fixed bug preventing proxy multipliers from being properly
integrated in
             function-based and raw MPMs.
          5. Corrected issue in which truncated distributions occasionally
led to NA
             size probabilities when the probability of a 0 under the
un-truncated
             distribution was sufficiently high.

survival and
             fecundity elements.
          3. Eliminated bug in functions flefko3(), flefko2(), and
aflefko2()
             preventing incorporation of random year effects into matrix
estimation.

respectively.
        USER-VISIBLE CHANGES
          1. Functions rlefko2() and rlefko3() now provide warnings if
individual
             identity variable name or column number is not provided.

I seem to be able to reproduce the errors by setting options(verbose
= TRUE) and then trying to parse the NEWS file with
tools:::.news_reader_default('https://r-forge.r-project.org/scm/viewvc.php/*checkout*/pkg/NEWS?revision=95&root=lefko3').
(It's not a documented entry point, but it's what gets called to read
the news database for your package.)

A plain text NEWS file is supposed to follow a format described in
?news. Your NEWS file looks like Markdown; in fact,
tools:::.build_news_db_from_package_NEWS_md('https://r-forge.r-project.org/scm/viewvc.php/*checkout*/pkg/NEWS?revision=95&root=lefko3')
parses it without producing error messages (so renaming NEWS into
NEWS.md could work around your immediate problems), but the result
doesn't look well: each numbered list is collapsed into a single
paragraph. Try separating the subsections (e.g. "NEW FEATURES" and
"USER-VISIBLE CHANGES") into separate Markdown paragraphs with
double-newlines and following other recommendations for Markdown news
files in ?news.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Using function with same name as argument as default
 argument
Message-ID: <64133a55-2ba0-448c-1770-02fdce65b797@dds.nl>

Not sure if this belongs on r-help or r-package-devel; decided for the 
latter as the question is mainly relevant when writing code to be used 
by others.

The issue I run into is that I want to write a function similar to:


foo <- function(x, schema = schema(x)) {
   if (is.null(schema)) stop("schema missing")
   # ...
}

with 'schema()' something like (strongly simplified):

schema <- function(x) attr(x, "schema")


However using both the argument schema and calling the schema() function 
in one of the default arguments is not allowed ans results in the 
following somewhat cryptic error message:

Error in foo(1:3) :
   promise already under evaluation: recursive default argument 
reference or earlier problems?

I am looking for a clean solution to this. I can rename the argument or 
function, but calling it something other than schema feels impractical 
as both refer to the same thing (the schema of x). The best solution I 
have come up with until now is to define a second function to be used in 
default function arguments:

schema_ <- schema

foo <- function(x, schema = schema_(x)) {
   if (is.null(schema)) stop("schema missing")
   # ...
}

I guess another solution would be:

foo <- function(x, schema) {
   if (missing(schema)) schema <- schema(x)
}

But then it is not clear for the user from the interface that the 
'schema' argument can be omitted.

I am hoping some of you have other suggestions.

And, is this something that could be 'fixed' in the R-parser?


Thanks,
Jan

Hello,


This isn't something that can be fixed in the parser. If an argument isn't
provided, its default value is evaluated inside the function, so it gives
you a loop where schema = schema(x), but then what's schema, it's
schema(x), thus the recursion error. you could do something like this:

foo <- function (x, schema = schema(x))
{
    if (missing(schema)) {
        rm(schema)
        schema <- schema(x)
    }
}

which, while kinda gross looking, means that schema = schema(x) can be
evaluated without causing a recursion error.

Here's a workaround that should work inside a package:

function(x, schema = mypackagename::schema(x))

For inline functions, this workaround is also possible, but I can only
think of an extremely ugly variant:

schema <- function(x) { force(x); 'schema' }
foo <- function(
 x, schema = get('schema', parent.env(environment()))(x)
) { force(schema); 'foo' }
foo(1) # works

Best regards,

Hi Andrew and Ivan,

Thanks for the suggestion. Both are good suggestions; better than what I 
have.


Andrews solution:

 > foo <- function (x, schema = schema(x))
 > {
 >      if (missing(schema)) {
 >          rm(schema)
 >          schema <- schema(x)

Ivans:

 > function(x, schema = mypackagename::schema(x))

Both would work in this case. Ivans is a bit cleaner/simpler; Andrews 
appears simpler from a user perspective. Not sure yet which one I will 
use; I am currently leaning towards Ivans solution.

Thanks!
Jan

I kind of prefer Ivan's solution.  A variation on Andrew's that doesn't 
require you to code the default in two places is:

foo <- function(x, schema = schema(x)) {
   if (missing(schema)) {
     default <- substitute(schema)
     rm(schema)
     schema <- eval(default)
   }
}

You could also change the name of the argument and let users rely on 
partial argument matching:


foo <- function(x, schema. = schema(x)) {
    schema <- schema.   # if you don't want to type the dot again
    if (is.null(schema)) stop("schema missing")
    # ...
}

This allows users to say foo(x, schema = myschema(x)) .

However, I'd say it's not a great design.  Probably changing your 
function name to `getSchema` would be the best overall solution:


foo <- function(x, schema = getSchema(x)) {
    if (is.null(schema)) stop("schema missing")
    # ...
}

Functions do actions, so their names should be verb-like.

Dear Jan,

Here's yet another solution that takes advantage of partial matching:

 > foo <- function(x, schema. = schema(x)) {
+   if (is.null(schema.)) stop("schema missing")
+   x
+ }

 > schema <- function(x) attr(x, "schema")

 > y <- 1
 > z <- 2
 > attr(y, "schema") <- "bar"

 > foo(y)
[1] 1
attr(,"schema")
[1] "bar"

 > foo(z)
Error in foo(z) : schema missing

 > foo(z, schema="baz")
[1] 2


I hope this helps,
  John

Thanks.

I think I prefer Ivan's solution too.

Thought about naming the function something like that. On the other 
hand, a lot of base R functions follow the following pattern in a 
similar case

foo <- levels(x)
levels(x) <- ...

(There is also a `schema<-` method). Other examples of this are 'attr', 
'class', 'length', 'dim', and 'names'. So for getters and setters the 
pattern seems to be to not use get and set. I like this feature of R, so 
would like to stick with it.

Best,
Jan

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Inputenc error when submitting package
Message-ID: <6FF6B300-65CC-4B56-AE2A-FFCAB8D583B1@biol.lu.se>

Dear fellow R-developers,
I received an error when submitting my package MHCtools v. 1.4.3 to CRAN, and I?m simply blank on what to do.

Please see: <https://CRAN.R-project.org/web/checks/check_results_MHCtools.html>

It appears to concern the pdf version of the manual, which is generated by the CRAN servers from the markdown docs in the package folder ?man?, which in turn are generated by Roxygen from the R code files. If I undestand the CRAN package check results correctly, the problem seems to be some characters, that are not translated by the package inputenc in the CRAN server:

    ! Package inputenc Error: Unicode char ?<c2><80><c2><90> (U+2010)
    (inputenc) not set up for use with LaTeX.

This was also listed as existing problems for the previous version of MHCtools (1.4.2), and I?m equally baffled about that, because that passed CRAN submission without errors on May 23rd this year.

I have browsed through all my code files and all the markdown files in the package folder ?man?, and I don?t find any odd characters.

Interestingly, I don?t get the error when running check_win_devel() or check_rhub().

I hope someone can shed some light on what is going on here.

Kind regards,

U+2010 is the hyphen character.  It looks a lot like the ascii "-" (code 
2D), which Unicode calls "hyphen-minus".

You can find occurrences of it (and other non-ASCII chars) in your files 
using the tools::showNonASCIIfile() function, e.g.

   files <- list.files(recursive = TRUE)
   for (f in files) tools::showNonASCIIfile(f)

In most fonts, "\u2010" is indistinguishable from the ASCII 
"hyphen-minus". LaTeX/inputenc gained support for the Unicode hyphen in 
the March 2016 release (substituting an ASCII hyphen), so you need a 
rather old OS to reproduce the error.

Among CRAN's check systems, r-oldrel-windows seems to be the only one 
using a sufficiently old LaTeX version. FWIW, Debian oldoldstable 
(stretch) is at TeX Live 2016, so supports U+2010.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Advice concerning a wrapper package
Message-ID: <91E98C94545DA84BBCE16EE6BB38CFB4015B2244B1@irsn.fr>

Dear all,

This is a slightly exotic situation: I need to publish on CRAN an R package, which do not hold any source code itself, just makefiles and scripts.
The whole source code belongs to another project (C++, python, R, ...) and for now I put it in another directory at same level that R, inst, ...
Indeed, this directory is a git submodule of the wrapped project in C++, so my R package has just some scripts for pre-compile stuff, moving some dirs, ...

Of course, it returns some CRAN WARNING and NOTE due to that:
...
* checking top-level files ... NOTE
Non-standard file/directory found at top level:
  'libKriging'
...
* checking package subdirectories ... WARNING
Subdirectory 'src' contains no source files.
...
* checking use of PKG_*FLAGS in Makefiles ... NOTE
   PKG_CPPFLAGS set in 'src/Makevars' without any corresponding files
   PKG_CXXFLAGS set in 'src/Makevars.win' without any corresponding files
   PKG_CPPFLAGS set in 'src/Makevars.win' without any corresponding files
* checking use of SHLIB_OPENMP_*FLAGS in Makefiles ... NOTE
  src/Makevars.win: SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS is included in PKG_CXXFLAGS without any C++ files
  src/Makevars.win: SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS is included in PKG_LIBS but linking is by C
...


My questions:

* any ideas to fix these warnings ?
* what will be really blocking for CRAN submisison ? (I mean which NOTE should be 'tolerated' ?)
* do you already know such exotic container-package that could hold some good ideas ?

Best regards,

Yann

This should be fixed by putting that directory under "inst".  Then it 
will be installed to the top level.

If your package is accepted by CRAN and a user chooses to install it, 
where will they get the source files from?

Message-ID: <CAEf_eRCv4SNL5Fh5WFg7iq9OuDwEQ92=3t_v6TF658iPr4UYww@mail.gmail.com>

Hello. Here is my "NOTE" message.

* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
Maintainer: ?Edward Wei <edwwei2020 at gmail.com>?

New submission

Possibly misspelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  alphavantager (8:3, 9:7)
  Alphavantager (7:32)
  api (7:58, 8:36)
  Avfintools (10:18)
  Vantager (3:55, 10:46, 11:56)

* checking top-level files ... NOTE
Non-standard file/directory found at top level:
  ?avfintools.tar.gz?

My questions are:

1. My misspelled words are just referencing names of packages and
programming terms etc. Is there a way to get around this or should I omit
them from my description and put them somewhere else.

2. I wanted to confirm this, but the tar.gz for CRAN submission SHOULD NOT
be in the folder of the directory for my package.

Thanks for your time,

You can try to surround package names in singe quotes <'>.

Right. However, you can want to distribute some auxiliary data, e.g. 
data supporting examples in your doc. In this case, such auxiliary files 
can go in "inst/" directory. All the content from this directory will be 
placed in the root of your package. So it may be more informative for an 
end-user to place them in "inst/examples/" or alike. Thus, the user will 
find them in "<package_dir>/examples/".

Best,
Serguei.

Software names should be single quotes in the Title and Description 
fields of the DESCRIPTION file. Other "possibly misspelled" words that 
are actually fine will be reviewed by manual inspection anyway. Just 
ignore these.

No. You should submit a package created by R CMD build which will not 
generated tar.gz files within in your package structure.

The normal layout would put .cpp and .h files in src, and .R files in R. 
  The src directory can have subdirectories, e.g. src/libKriging.  Those 
won't get compiled automatically, but your makefiles can compile them.

If you can, mention them in the comments to the CRAN submission.

Check your R CMD build process. There seemed to have been an
avfintools.tar.gz file in the package directory at the time when you
were preparing the package tarball. If you prefer to build the package
in the current directory (i.e. by running R CMD build .) or otherwise
need that file there, use .Rbuildignore to prevent it from ending up
inside the tarball. For example, you can put \.tar\.gz$ on a line there
to skip all files with names ending with .tar.gz.

Thank you for your answer.

All sources (.cpp, .h and .R files) are in the libKriging directory, so as you suggested inside inst/libKriging
But as the whole size before compiling is exceeding 15MB, I would add some cleanup to delete inst/libKriging sources after compiling.
Is it a bad solution ?

Regards

Yann

This should be fixed by putting that directory under "inst".  Then it
will be installed to the top level.

If your package is accepted by CRAN and a user chooses to install it,
where will they get the source files from?

Hello, Edward Wei:


	  Are you familiar with R Packages (2nd edition) Hadley Wickham and 
Jenny Bryan?


https://r-pkgs.org


	  This book is the most up-to-date information I know on preparing 
something for CRAN.  To your question specifically, I have a "WORDLIST" 
file in an "inst" folder.


	  Below please find notes I've prepared for myself on the various tests 
I've gotten from their book, etc.  The section numbers refer to an 
earlier version of this book.  Ignore or use with caution.


	  Hope this helps.

Hi,

For quite some time my .Rd files had 'cases' environments like these:

\deqn{F(x) = \cases{
1,&if x > 0,\cr
0,&if x = 0.\cr}}{...}

Since recently, r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-clang and r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-gcc trigger the note 'Undefined control sequence: \cases in F(x) = \cases{...', possibly due to KaTeX rendering help pages. I looked around quite a bit but couldn't find a way to implement 'cases' environments. For example, https://katex.org/docs/supported.html#environments mentions \begin{cases} \end{cases}, so I tried

\deqn{F(x) = \begin{cases}
1,&\text{if}\ x > 0,\\
0,&\text{if} x = 0.}}{...}

but that triggers:

...
* checking PDF version of manual ... WARNING
LaTeX errors when creating PDF version.
This typically indicates Rd problems.
LaTeX errors found:
! Misplaced alignment tab character &
....

What is the proper way (is there one?) to get displayed 'cases' environments in .Rd files?

Thanks & cheers,
Marius

Yes, the PDF refmans don't support amsmath (so no \begin{pmatrix},
\begin{cases}, etc.), although \pmatrix and \cases are supported. KaTeX has
it the other way around.

Unfortunately there is no nice workaround at the moment. Even if the PDF
version begins supporting \begin{cases} by including amsmath, \cases will
stop working, and your package will need to depend on a very recent R.

Possibly the only practical workaround is to use more basic LaTeX
constructs such as \begin{array}.

Best,

There is a possible workaround, but it's the opposite of beautiful. You
can use conditional text to compile one version of the formula for HTML
help and another one for PDF help:

\ifelse{html}{\eqn{\begin{cases}...}}{\eqn{\cases{...}}{ascii}}

It's as tedious as it looks. For extra style(?) points, you can put a
three-argument user-defined macro in man/macros/whatever.Rd that
forwards its arguments to one of the \ifelse branches. As far as I
remember, \newcommand{}{} has to fit on one line, but in R ? 3.6.0,
macros themselves can take multi-line arguments.

If you're targeting an earlier version of R, you can make multi-line
arguments work by forcing R to cache the parse tree of the man page
while building a source tarball with a newer R version using
\Sexpr[stage=build]{}, costing you some time during R CMD build and a
slightly larger source tarball. (It's an implementation detail that one
normally shouldn't depend upon. Thankfully, as of 2022, there won't be
any newer versions of R ? 3.5.x to break it.) Support for
man/macros/*.Rd only appeared in R-3.2.0, so I haven't researched
compatibility tricks for even older versions of R.

Hi,

Thanks everyone for your suggestions. I now went with the easiest solution, namely something of the form

\deqn{F(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
1,&\text{if}\ x > 0,\\
0,&\text{if} x = 0.
\end{array}\right.}{...}

which worked flawlessly (and avoids having to type the formula twice or define a macro as suggested by Ivan).

Cheers,
Marius

I am currently developing an R package that translates R expressions to Html and Latex, things like dbinom(x, size, prob) to P\left(x; N, \pi\right)

Generation of Rd files may be an interesting use case. It's still at an early stage, I appreciate contributions and interesting feature requests.

I have been trying to sort out an odd issue for the last few days in upgrading package
nlsr (for nonlinear least squares). It generally does much better in finding solutions from
poor starts than nls(), but it does not generate the full nls returned object. I've written a
wrapper wrapnlsr() that calls my nlsr functions then uses the resulting parameters in nls()
to get the nls object. But up to now, neither weights nor subset are allowed. I've not got
to subset, but have been trying weights, with very strange results. The full example is too
much code for the list, so I've faked the nlsr output as "firstcoef" in the example below.
What is troubling is that a hand-run example "works", but using a function to do it fails
when there are weights.

The nls.R code referenced in the example around line 570 may suggest that its handling the
weights may be the culprit here. I don't understand why
     eval(substitute(weights), data, environment(formula))
is needed for a fixed numeric vector of weights (as required by the manual).

Any help welcome.

The example:

# wterr.R -- reproduce nls error when called from function
rm(list=ls()) # probably not needed, but clear the workspace

tnow <- function(formula, data, start, control, trace) {
   firstcoef <- c(b1=199, b2=50, b3=0.3) # as if from another solver
   cat("firstcoef:\n")
   print(firstcoef)
   cat("No weights\n")
   second<-nls(formula, data, firstcoef, control, algorithm=NULL, TRUE)
   second
}

tw <- function(formula, data, start, control, trace, weights) {
   firstcoef <- c(b1=199, b2=50, b3=0.3)
   cat("firstcoef:\n")
   print(firstcoef)
   cat("weights:"); print(weights)
   secondw<-nls(formula, data, firstcoef, control, algorithm=NULL, TRUE, weights=weights)
   secondw
}

weed <- c(5.308, 7.24, 9.638, 12.866, 17.069, 23.192, 31.443,
           38.558, 50.156, 62.948, 75.995, 91.972)

st2 <- c(b1=200, b2=50, b3=0.3)
wts <- 0.5^tt # a straight scaling comes via wts <- rep(0.01, 12)
# From this level, we can do the calculation

This is an unfortunate problem caused by non-standard evaluation of the
`weights` argument. It happens with `lm()`, too. To solve it, you should
use do.call(), e.g.,

secondw <- do.call("nls", list(formula, data, firstcoef, control,
algorithm=NULL, TRUE, weights = weights))

The reason this works is that `weights` is evaluated in the `list()` call,
which uses standard evaluation, before being passed to `nls()`, rather than
in the `nls()` call. Using `alist()` instead, which doesn't evaluate its
arguments, creates the same problem. You unfortunately have to do this with
every function that involves nonstandard evaluation.

The error that you get, "invalid type (closure) for variable '(weights)'",
occurs because `nls()` is interpreting `weights` as the function
`weights()`, which is a closure (basically the same thing as a function),
rather than as the argument passed through the `weights` argument of
`tw()`.

Dear John,

This is a scoping issue due to how model formulas are evaluated by nls() 
and other modeling functions. Try this:

tw2 <- function(formula, data, start, control, trace, weights) {
   firstcoef <- c(b1=199, b2=50, b3=0.3)
   cat("firstcoef:\n")
   print(firstcoef)
   cat("weights:"); print(weights)
   data$weights <- weights
   secondw<-nls(formula, data, firstcoef, control, algorithm=NULL, TRUE, 
weights=weights)
   secondw
}

 > tw2(hobbsu, weeddf, st2, control=list(), trace=TRUE, weights=wts)
firstcoef:
    b1    b2    b3
199.0  50.0   0.3
weights: [1] 0.5000000000 0.2500000000 0.1250000000 0.0625000000 
0.0312500000 0.0156250000
  [7] 0.0078125000 0.0039062500 0.0019531250 0.0009765625 0.0004882812 
0.0002441406
0.3342481   (3.98e+00): par = (199 50 0.3)
0.01987378  (1.14e-01): par = (199.2897 50.14155 0.3139337)
0.01961683  (2.88e-04): par = (199.8481 50.2582 0.3133964)
0.01961683  (1.97e-06): par = (199.8595 50.26061 0.3133932)
Nonlinear regression model
   model: weed ~ b1/(1 + b2 * exp(-b3 * tt))
    data: data
       b1       b2       b3
199.8595  50.2606   0.3134
  weighted residual sum-of-squares: 0.01962

Number of iterations to convergence: 3
Achieved convergence tolerance: 1.975e-06

(Your second attempt worked because you stuck the variable weights in 
the global environment.)

I hope that this does what you want.

Thanks to John Fox and Noah Greifer. Both their approaches resolved my immediate
problem.

That is, to provide a summary of the fix of my example code,

tw <- function(formula, data, start, control, trace, weights) {
   firstcoef <- c(b1=199, b2=50, b3=0.3)
   cat("firstcoef:\n")
   print(firstcoef)
   cat("weights:"); print(weights)
# Following fails -- closure error
#  secondw<-nls(formula, data, firstcoef, control, algorithm=NULL, TRUE, weights=weights)
# from noah.greifer at gmail.com # this works OK
   secondw <- do.call("nls", list(formula, data, firstcoef, control, algorithm=NULL, TRUE, weights = weights))
#  As does putting weights in the data dataframe (here not active)
#  data$weights <- weights # from John Fox
#  secondw<-nls(formula, data, firstcoef, control, algorithm=NULL, TRUE, weights=weights)
   secondw
}

Afraid I avoid the wonders of non-standard evaluation, and this time it jumped up and bit me.
But then I remember what machine instruction 260000800009 did on an IBM 1620.

The swiftness of reply from John and Noah was much appreciated.

Best, JN

Dear John,

After further thought, it's probably a better idea to evaluate the 
weights argument in the same environment as the formula rather than to 
bypass nonstandard evaluation. You could use lm() as a guide. I don't 
entirely understand what you're trying to do so maybe this suggestion is 
off-base.

Best,
  John

This posting is to answer "what I'm trying to do". Otherwise can be skipped.

My nlsr package has a completely different structure (philosophy?) from nls(). My aim is to
try VERY hard to get solutions and not give up with "singular gradient" or other issues as
nls() does. But the package is quite lean and doesn't return a lot of useful bits and pieces,
such as nls returned functions and model stuff. So I've got a wrapnlsr() function that runs my
solver, then passes the best parameters to nls(). This won't always work, for example, if
the Jacobian at the best parameters is still singular, but very often it will, and the
wrapper then returns all the goodies and a user can use the output as per nls().

Because my activities don't often get into those spin-offs of nls() -- for instance the
profile plots -- I really need some collaborators if nlsr is going to get more capable in
that regard. However, I feel the wrapper is at least a start.

For anyone interested, I have been tightening up the nlsr package and also trying to build a
quite comprehensive collection of examples. Some areas of improvement are in applying bounds
and masks (fixed parameters) and using selfStart models. There is still plenty to do, but the
base package nlsr should be upgraded on CRAN in a few weeks. If anyone is anxious to try it,
let me know. The changes are mostly internal. The examples collection is going to take a bit
longer to get tidy, but I'll be happy to share those too. Material is on Gitlab or Github,
though definitely a work in progress and updated daily, often with loose ends.

Best, JN

PS. Why would we "evaluate" the weights? The nls() man-page says they are fixed numbers, but
the nls.R code I pointed to does evaluate them, and that seems to be the trouble. Is that a bug?

Dear John,

If I understand correctly, there are two contexts here: (1) the 
interface for your wrapnlsr() function, and (2) how nlsr() calls other 
functions, including nls().

The first should probably work like a standard statistical modelling 
function, including how the weights argument is evaluated. The second is 
hidden from the user, and is where the scoping issue that you reported 
arose. My suggestion to follow a standard statistical modelling function 
here is probably off-base, and the previous two solutions, one from me 
and one from Noah, both work.

With respect to my solution: if you actually adopt it, I'd prefer not to 
use a name like data$weights, for fear of overwriting an existing 
variable in data called weights, but rather some like .weights or even 
..weights.. .

I'm probably the wrong person for this -- I'm familiar with nonlinear 
regression, but your knowledge of the computational details vastly 
exceeds mine.

What I meant by "evaluate" was associate a value with the symbol 
weights. The scoping issue was that nls() ended up looking in the global 
environment, where it found the weights() function rather than the local 
variable (i.e., argument) weights in your function.

Best,

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Windows check time blowout on R-devel
Message-ID: <SY4PR01MB5658B18A5A97B37DA06BDE0AAC669@SY4PR01MB5658.ausprd01.prod.outlook.com>

A slight revision of a longstanding CRAN package 'secr' (prompted by CRAN changes in math rendering) was archived on pre-test because of an increase in overall check time on R-devel. This seems to be beyond my control - what should I do?

The package is at https://github.com/MurrayEfford/secr.

I have extracted what seem like the relevant check lines below
