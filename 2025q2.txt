You have to build the package with R-devel or R-prerelease, then the

Yes and no. Yes, true and false are the same. No, because there is also 
__bool_true_false_are_defined which is set to 1 and this can make the 
compiler react differently in various situations.

I think it would be good and safe idea.

Message-ID: <CAJuCY5xfn7uykxM2JHPOWgkzUPrjXz8tpJ-3E_=GFw7XucuYfA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

When checking a package via a GitHub action I often (but not always) get a
connection-time out for the GNU license page. The github actions runs the
code below

   Sys.setenv("R_DEFAULT_INTERNET_TIMEOUT" = 360)
   options(timeout = max(360, getOption("timeout")))
    rcmdcheck::rcmdcheck(
      path = x$get_path, args = c("--timings", "--as-cran", "--no-manual"),
      error_on = "never", timeout = Inf
    )

The resulting NOTE

Found the following (possibly) invalid URLs:
  URL: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html
    From: README.md
    Status: Error
    Message: libcurl error code 28:
      Failed to connect to www.gnu.org port 443 after 136189 ms: Couldn't
connect to server

I'm guessing that https://www.gnu.org is blocking the request from the
GitHub Action. Any suggestions how to fix this note without removing the
URL for the README?

Best regards,

Thierry

I think it should be possible to set the environment variable
_R_CHECK_CRAN_INCOMING_REMOTE_=FALSE to disable the "remote" checks [*]
(including checks for repository content) or
_R_CHECK_CRAN_INCOMING_SKIP_URL_CHECKS_IF_REMOTE_=TRUE to only skip the
URL checks.

Dear Ivan,

Thanks for the feedback. Skipping all URL checks is not an ideal solution.
Getting a NOTE for a broken link is valuable. Given that the problem occurs
over several repositories but always with the gnu.org domain, I was hoping
for a more tailored solution.

Removing the problematic URL is probably the best solution for now.

Best regards,

Thierry

Message-ID: <cc4856a9-3a87-4f9b-a0f1-6ce40b1d5e45@gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm trying to submit a new version of a package to CRAN. Among the 
additions is an RMarkdown vignette that uses data from a website that is 
no longer active. For completeness, i'd still like to cite the invalid 
URL, but without formatting it as a hyperlink. What is the preferred way 
to do this?

One StackExchange answer is to surround the URL with <span></span>, but 
this did not remove the hyperlink when i rendered the vignette locally. 
Instead, i surrounded it with back-ticks, which works locally, but i've 
been unable to run Win-Builder checks to see whether this prevents the 
"invalid URLs" NOTE. And, even if the NOTE is prevented, i'm not sure 
this is preferred.

Thank you,

Cory Brunson

Why not leave off the scheme, e.g. "www.r-project.org" instead of 
"https://www.r-project.org".

FWIW: connectivity from GH runners is notoriously patchy*, so I wouldn?t rely on those for URL checks, so I?d recommend using the solution by Ivan in actions and simply running a separate check without the option once in a while locally (e.g., before submission) to detect such issues. After all, the point of GHAs is to detect things you cannot detect locally (because of OS etc.) which this not the case here.

* - the failure rate is so high that pretty much all actions involving remote files include provisions for several retries, otherwise your actions will fail on a regular basis. That said, GNU servers are notoriously unreliable themselves, compounding the problem. Even in our macOS recipes I had to create a provision for automatic rewriting of gnu.org URLs to more reliable GNU mirrors as the master site is either slow or unresponsive very often, so this is not an unusual problem.

Cheers,
Simon

Could you potentially look for the original website in the internet archive
/ wayback machine: https://web.archive.org/ and cite that instead?

Thank you both!

Nicholas, i did check the Wayback Machine; the URL was never archived, 
nor was the domain itself (in case you're curious, www.ibge.Goi?sv.br/).

Duncan, that worked at preventing the hyperlink locally; thank you. But 
i got a new error from Win-Builder (the development version via 
devtools::check_win_devel() but not the release version via 
devtools::check_win_release()). It seems to apply to all URLs and DOIs, 
though i did not get it on any previous check:

Checking URLs failed with message:
 ? there is no package called 'curl'

Checking DOIs failed with message:
 ? there is no package called 'curl'

I went looking for links to this domain on the Web, found the link in
the documentation for the 'ripserr' package, and then found what looks
like a domain where the desired page could be found. Could it be

https://www.ibge.gov.br/geociencias/organizacao-do-territorio/estrutura-territorial/15761-areas-dos-municipios.html?edicao=30133&t=acesso-ao-produto

instead of the original link?

https://www.ibge.Goiasv.br/geociencias/organizacao-do-territorio/estrutura-territorial/15761-areas-dos-municipios.html?edicao=30133&t=acesso-ao-produto?

Looks like Win-Builder for R-devel is having transient problems:
https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-devel-windows-x86_64/curl-00install.html

("ERROR: cannot remove earlier installation, is it in use?", and then
it fails to overwrite libs\x64\curl.dll with "Permission denied".)

Ivan, thank you! That seems to be correct. I'll replace the link.

For future reference in answer to the original question, it seems that 
Duncan's suggestion works best, assuming that the 'curl' problem was 
unrelated.

 [My solution] How and where do I document sysdata.rda

I promised I would update on this.

I now realise that what I was tryig to do was logically impossible. I 
was trying to hide the data set (achieved) but also hide the 
documentation. That makes no sense as anyone wanting to change the 
dataset would not know where to find the documentation. The probabiliy 
anyone would want to edit it is almost indsitinguishable from zero but 
it is as Charles suggests a good principle.

So the answer is to document it in the usual way and use the keyword 
internal. The main difference from a standard Rd file for data is the 
usage statement. As georgi pointed out this just consists of the dataset 
name not data(datasetname).

Thanks for all your help on this and sorry it took so long to respond.
