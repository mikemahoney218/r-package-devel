Hello Ivan.

The Does list.files(pattern = 'utils|Rout\\.fail') gave me something like
an empty string.

So after getting some in-person help on this issue, the key to resolving
this error was explicitly defining the environmental variables in the
console as:

set
PDFLATEX=C:\Users\edmon\AppData\Local\Programs\MiKTeX\miktex\bin\x64\pdflatex



set
MAKEINDEX=C:\Users\edmon\AppData\Local\Programs\MiKTeX\miktex\bin\x64\makeindex


The makeindex was a package I was apparently missing for MikTex and I had
to download it as part of generating the manual.


I would have to set up the environmental variables every time that R got
started in order for the R CMD check to run smoothly.


Best regards,

Hi,

Thanks a lot Henrik for your detailed response, the problem was the one you suspected a "plan(mutlisession)" that was not correctly closed. And following your advice I was able to reproduce it on winbuilder.

So thanks again for your help!

Best regards, 

Etienne

Hi.

> Found the following files/directories:
> 'Rscript306c1f1adf1' 'Rscript3fb41f1adf1'

Whenever seeing detritus files with name Rscript<hexcode> like these,
it's a strong suggestion that parallel workers on MS Windows are
involved.  More precisely, each of them is from a separate PSOCK
cluster node worker typically launched by parallel::makeCluster().
When such workers are launched in example code, unit tests, or
vignettes those files are created by R itself when running on MS
Windows.  If the workers are not properly shutdown (e.g. forgetting to
call parallel::stopCluster()), those files are left behind, and 'R CMD
check' will detect them.

Now, from experience, but neither fully investigated not understood
yet, it *might* be that even if one calls parallel::stopCluster() at
the end of examples, unit tests, or vignettes, it might be that there
is still a race condition where the parallel workers are still in the
process of shutting down when 'R CMD check' is checking for detritus
files.  If that is the case, then it might be sporadic and tricky to
reproduce this problem.  This has happened to me exactly once. I'm
saying this, only in case you're struggle to reproduce it, but my
guess is that this is *not* the case here. Please see below for
options how to reproduce.

Now, I see you're using 'future' for parallelization.  Because of
this, I suspect you use plan(multisession), which launches parallel
PSOCK workers like parallel::makeCluster().  To shut down those
workers at the end, call plan(sequential).  My guess is that this is
your problem.  Before you do that, I would make sure you can reproduce
the problem first - see below.

> I did not manage to reproduce it with Rhub and github action.

1. Looking at your
https://github.com/comeetie/greed/blob/master/.github/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml,
I see you're not checking with **R-devel** on MS Windows. I suggest
you add that and too see if you can reproduce it there.  You could
also add an explicit `env: _R_CHECK_THINGS_IN_TEMP_DIR_: true` just in
case (but I'd guess --as-cran does this).

2. Similarly, did you make sure to test with R-devel on MS Windows on R-hub?

3. Did you try with R-devel on the win-builder service?

For your future needs (pun not intended), I would make sure you can
reproduce the problem before trying to fix it.

Hope this helps,

Henrik

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Guidance on splitting up an R package?
Message-ID: <CALnEB17ExKcv=+EH4NycFFta+jaF0N1FjbfCphttK=cnBdKgow@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am looking for guidance (blog posts / books / people with expertise) on
how to split up an R package that has grown a lot in complexity and size.
To make it worthwhile, the split needs to ease the maintenance and ongoing
development.

Here are my quick reflections on it:
1. Where possible try to preserve the consistency of the original R
package. So, spin-off packages should ideally become helper-packages to the
original package and tests need to be in place to ensure compatibility of
the original R package is preserved.
2. Keep similar functionality together. For example, a function to read
files does not have to be in the same package as a function to plot the
data, but a function to adjust the color coding of the plots should be
stored near the other plotting functions.
3. Try to isolate external dependencies. For example, if dependency Y
changes I ideally only have to worry about updating one of my R packages to
it instead of several.

I am wondering whether anyone else has ever made a more elaborate mapping
of do's and don'ts when it comes to splitting up an R package or any
software for that matter?

Vincent

Dear Vincent,

Have a look at the spatstat package which was split into several smaller
packages (https://github.com/spatstat/spatstat). Maybe the maintainers of
that package can share some insights.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] How to decrease time to import files in xlsx format?
Message-ID: <CAHGVjr=K9YbwVhEhxq_=9v_uxkT5FXzqhoyomdPWKn_erDsvDA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'm developing an R package that basically downloads, imports, cleans and
merges nine files in xlsx format updated monthly from a public institution.

The problem is that importing files in xlsx format is time consuming.

My initial idea was to parallelize the execution of the read_xlsx function
according to the number of cores in the user's processor, but apparently it
didn't make much difference, since when trying to parallelize it the
execution time went from 185.89 to 184.12 seconds:

# not parallelized code
y <- purrr::map_dfr(paste0(dir.temp, '/', lista.arquivos.locais),
               readxl::read_excel, sheet = 1, skip = 4, col_types =
c(rep('text', 30)))

# parallelized code
plan(strategy = future::multicore(workers = 4))
y <- furrr::future_map_dfr(paste0(dir.temp, '/', lista.arquivos.locais),
                             readxl::read_excel, sheet = 1, skip = 4,
col_types = c(rep('text', 30)))

 Any suggestions to reduce the import processing time?

Thanks in advance!

Do the openxlsx or XLConnect packages fare any better?

> plan(strategy = future::multicore(workers = 4))

As far as I understand the documentation, multicore only works on
POSIX-compatible operating systems when not running under RStudio (and
even then, some macOS APIs may be not fork()-safe). Which operating
system are you running? Does it get any better if you use
future::multisession?

Have you tried profiling the code? Do you see it using 100% of one
core in some kind of task manager?

In 2019, I split psych into psych and psychTools to meet the 5MB space restriction.  I moved several of vignettes, data sets, and a few helper functions over to psychTools. This mainly allowed for more vignettes but also allows me to add new data sets to psychTools without needing to recompile psych.   This is discussed in the news file for psych and psychTools.

It looks like you are reading directly from URLs? How do you know the delay is not network I/O delay?

Parallel computation is not a panacea. It allows tasks _that are CPU-bound_ to get through the CPU-intensive work faster. You need to be certain that your tasks actually can benefit from parallelism before using it... there is a significant overhead and added complexity to using parallel processing that will lead to SLOWER processing if mis-used.

Howdy Folks,

I got a message from CRAN today telling me that I have a strong reverse
dependency on the isoband package. But I'm not alone! It look like more
than 4700 other packages also have a strong dependency on this. Is there
some organized effort to deal with this?

Thanks

I think the short answer is yes, see the discussion on their GitHub:

R package ggplot2 imports isoband which resulted in the very large 
number of strong dependencies.

For my own R packages I could move ggplot2 from Imports to Suggests, 
however, I hope that I can simply wait this out.

 How to decrease time to import files in xlsx format?

According to my internet research, it looks like readxl is the fastest
package.

The profvis package indicated that the bottleneck is indeed in importing
the files.

My processor has six cores, but when I use four of them the computer
crashes completely. When I use three processors, it's still usable. So I
did one more benchmark comparing for loop, map_dfr and future_map_dfr (with
multisession and three cores).

After the benchmark was run 10 times, the result was:

             expr                  min          lq           mean
 median        uq      max neval
     import_for()        140.9940 147.9722 160.7229 155.6459 172.4661
199.1059    10
 import_map_dfr()   161.6707 339.6769 480.5760 567.8389 643.8895 666.0726
 10
   import_furrr()        112.1374 116.4301 127.5976 129.0067 137.9179
140.8632    10

For me it is proven that using the furrr package is the best solution in
this case, but what would explain so much difference with map_dfr?

Hey Igor,

I have been dealing with *CSV*/*XLSX* files from time to time and depending
on the size of those files you are mentioning, 180 seconds isn't really
that much.
From my experience, *vroom *is the fastest I've encountered but it deals
with *CSV* files (I can support its usage for up to 8gb size files).
If you have the option to import CSVs instead, you should give it a try.

Other than that there are several other factors to be considered, such as
memory and disk read/write capabilities.
And again, it is just 180 seconds so just suggest the user go get a cup of
coffee :)

Best,
Diego

Hi R pkg developers,

We are facing a datetime handling issue which manifests itself in a
package we are working on.

In context, we noticed that reading datetime info from an excel file
resulted in different data depending on the computer we used.

We are aware that timezone and regional settings are general sources
of troubles, but the code we are using was trying to circumvent this.
We went only as far as figuring out that the issue happens when
converting a POSIXlt into a POSIXct.

Please find below, a minimal reproducible example where `foo` is
converted to `bar` on two different computers.
`foo` is a POSIXlt with a defined time zone and upon conversion to a
POSIXct, despite using a set time zone, we end up with `bar` being
different on Linux and on a Windows machine.

We noticed that the difference emerges from the system call
`.Internal(as.POSIXct())` within `as.POSIXct.POSIXlt()`.
We also noticed that the internal function in R actually calls
getenv("TZ") within C, which is probably what explains where the
difference comes from.

Such a behaviour is probably expected and not a bug, but what would be
the strategy to convert a POSIXlt into a POSIXct that would not be
machine dependent?

We finally noticed that depending on the datetime used as a starting
point and on the time zone used when calling `as.POSIXct()`, we
sometimes have a difference between computers and sometimes not...
which adds to our puzzlement.

Many thanks.
Alex & Liam


``` r
## On Linux
foo <- structure(list(sec = 0, min = 0L, hour = 0L, mday = 1L, mon =
9L, year = 121L, wday = 5L, yday = 273L, isdst = 0L),
                 class = c("POSIXlt", "POSIXt"), tzone = "UTC")

bar <- as.POSIXct(foo, tz = "Europe/Berlin")

bar
#> [1] "2021-10-01 01:00:00 CEST"

dput(bar)
#> structure(1633042800, class = c("POSIXct", "POSIXt"), tzone =
"Europe/Berlin")
```

``` r
## On Windows
foo <- structure(list(sec = 0, min = 0L, hour = 0L, mday = 1L, mon =

                 class = c("POSIXlt", "POSIXt"), tzone = "UTC")

bar <- as.POSIXct(foo, tz = "Europe/Berlin")

bar

Alexandre,

it's better to parse the timestamp in correct timezone:

> foo = as.POSIXlt("2021-10-01", "UTC")
> as.POSIXct(as.character(foo), "Europe/Berlin")
[1] "2021-10-01 CEST"

The issue stems from the fact that you are pretending like your timestamp is UTC (which it is not) while you want to interpret the same values in a different time zone. The DST flags varies depending on the day (due to DST being 0 or 1 depending on the date) and POSIXlt does not have that information since you only attached the time zone without updating it:

> str(unclass(as.POSIXlt(foo, "Europe/Berlin")))
List of 9
 $ sec  : num 0
 $ min  : int 0
 $ hour : int 0
 $ mday : int 1
 $ mon  : int 9
 $ year : int 121
 $ wday : int 5
 $ yday : int 273
 $ isdst: int 0
 - attr(*, "tzone")= chr "Europe/Berlin"

note that isdst is 0 from the UTC entry (which doesn't have DST) even though that date is actually DST in CEST. Compare that to the correctly parsed POSIXlt:

> str(unclass(as.POSIXlt(as.character(foo), "Europe/Berlin")))
List of 11
 $ sec   : num 0
 $ min   : int 0
 $ hour  : int 0
 $ mday  : int 1
 $ mon   : int 9
 $ year  : int 121
 $ wday  : int 5
 $ yday  : int 273
 $ isdst : int 1
 $ zone  : chr "CEST"
 $ gmtoff: int NA
 - attr(*, "tzone")= chr "Europe/Berlin"

where isdst is 1 since it is indeed the DST. The OS difference seems to be that Linux respects the isdst information from POSIXlt while Windows and macOS ignores it. This behavior is documented: 

     At all other times ?isdst? can be deduced from the
     first six values, but the behaviour if it is set incorrectly is
     platform-dependent.

You can re-set isdst to -1 to make sure R will try to determine it:

> foo$isdst = -1L
> as.POSIXct(foo, "Europe/Berlin")
[1] "2021-10-01 CEST"

So, generally, you cannot simply change the time zone in POSIXlt - don't pretend the time is in UTC if it's not, you have to re-parse or re-compute the timestamps for it to be reliable or else the DST flag will be wrong.

Cheers,
Simon

... which is why tidyverse functions and Python datetime handling irk me so much.

Is tidyverse time handling intrinsically broken? They have a standard practice of reading time as UTC and then using force_tz to fix the "mistake". Same as Python.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Identify Original Column Names of Model Matrix
Message-ID: <SY2PR01MB30033EFCF280CCC2EB45B06DCD209@SY2PR01MB3003.ausprd01.prod.outlook.com>

Good day,

I am developing a wrapper around xgboost which does not (yet - I see that it is on the developer's version 2.0 task list) support factor variable type. It requires input data to be in one-hot encoding, which is created by Matrix::sparse.model.matrix. For further analysis, such as variable importance, is there a way to identify which original feature each column of a sparse.model.matrix result was derived from? Using str(oneHotMatrix), I don't see any class slots nor tacked-on attributes which would confidently allow the identification of original column names of the expanded input data. Is there an alternative way to robustly identify the original variable names?

Can you point to any docs that lead you to this conclusion so we can
get them fixed? I strongly encourage people to parse date-times in the
correct time zone; this is why lubridate::ymd_hms() and friends have a
tz argument.

Message-ID: <CAPPM_gT_Fh61FzGmrsQZt7dNWiZs6J6pxjFwiGGUNbQ2hQbhNw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'd like to link to a help page of a package in my package's Suggests.
WRE, section 2.5 says,

"Historically (before R version 4.1.0), links of the form
\link[pkg]{foo} and \link[pkg:bar]{foo} used to be interpreted as
links to files foo.html and bar.html in package pkg, respectively. For
this reason, the HTML help system looks for file foo.html in package
pkg if it does not find topic foo, and then searches for the topic in
other installed packages. To test that links work both with both old
and new systems, the pre-4.1.0 behaviour can be restored by setting
the environment variable _R_HELP_LINKS_TO_TOPICS_=false.

"Packages referred to by these ?other forms? should be declared in the
DESCRIPTION file, in the ?Depends?, ?Im
ports?, ?Suggests? or ?Enhances? fields."

This seems to imply that it's possible... though I don't understand
when I need to set _R_HELP_LINKS_TO_TOPICS_=false in order to test
that the link is done correctly. I'm using \link[pkg]{foo} in R 4.2.1.

I ran R CMD build/INSTALL/check with and without that env var set to
false. Both times the suggested package was not installed on my
library path, so I had to set _R_CHECK_FORCE_SUGGESTS_=false for R CMD
check --as-cran.

I didn't notice a difference in output from R CMD check. Both runs had:

    * checking Rd cross-references ... NOTE
    Package unavailable to check Rd xrefs: ?timeSeries?

I'd appreciate any thoughts and/or pointers to other documentation.

Best,
Josh

Liam,

I think I have failed to convey my main point in the last e-mail - which was that you want to parse the date/time in the timezone that you care about so in your example that would be

> foo <- as.Date(33874, origin = "1899-12-30")
> foo
[1] "1992-09-27"
> as.POSIXlt(as.character(foo), "Europe/Berlin")
[1] "1992-09-27 CEST"

I was explicitly saying that you do NOT want to simply change the time zone on POSIXlt objects as that won't work for reasons I explained - see my last e-mail.

Cheers,
Simon

Following your advice, `bar` is then a POSIXlt object where we now explicitly define timezone using argument tz. However, even though we are explicit about the timezone the POSIXlt that is generated is always in UTC. This then leads to the issues outlined by Alexandre above, which we now understand are caused by DST.

Alternatively, `lubridate::as_datetime()` does seem to recognise the tz argument and convert a Date object to POSIX* with non-UTC time zone (see second example below). But it would be nice to know if there are subtle differences between these two approaches that we should be aware of.

Hi Simon,

Thanks for the clarification.

From a naive developer point of view, we were initially baffled that the
generic as.POSIXlt() does very different things on a character and on a
Date input:

as.POSIXlt(as.character(foo), "Europe/Berlin")
[1] "1992-09-27 CEST"

as.POSIXlt(foo, "Europe/Berlin")
[1] "1992-09-27 UTC"

Based on what you said, it does make sense: it is only when creating the
date/time that we want to include the time zone and that only happens when
we don't already work on a previously created date.
That is your subtle but spot-on distinction between "parsing" and
"changing" the time zone.

Yet, we do find it dangerous that as.POSIXlt.Date() accepts a time zone but
does nothing of it, especially when the help file starts with:

Usage
as.POSIXlt(x, tz = "", ...)

The behaviour is documented, as Liam reported it, but still, we will almost
certainly not be the last one tripping on this (without even adding the
additional issue of as.POSIXct() behaving differently across OS).

Thanks again,

Alex & Liam

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Best way forward on a CRAN archived package
Message-ID: <CAA-ibaxp8a5uttw3hci2ZUXit-CjJZf4uaYaqR4zRuD--tAMrw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi:

I have some doubts on how to proceed in this case. I am the developer of
tidyterra, and I received an email from CRAN on 23Sep2022 about an issue on
the package, setting a deadline on 07Oct2022 to correct it.

I sent a patch that was accepted on CRAN on 29Sep2022, that fixed the issue
(or at least I am pretty sure I solved it). I received no further feedback
by CRAN, so I assumed the package was safe. However it was finally archived
on 07Oct2022.

I have already sent an email to CRAN in order to check if they think the
issues still persist (or maybe they missed the patch submission?), but I am
in a rush since there are other packages that depend on tidyterra and they
may be in risk of being archived on CRAN as well.

So my question is: What is the best way forward at this point? Should I
wait to get some feedback from CRAN or is it best to resubmit the package
(I already have a new patch prepared)? I acknowledge that  "The time of the
volunteers is CRAN?s most precious resource" so my goal is to reduce their
burden as much as possible.

Kind regards

Have a nice day!

   Right now as.POSIXlt.Date() is just

function (x, ...)
.Internal(Date2POSIXlt(x))

How expensive would it be to throw a warning when '...' is provided by 
the user/discarded ??

Alternately, perhaps the documentation could be amended, although I'm 
not quite sure what to suggest. (The sentence Liam refers to, "Dates 
without times are treated as being at midnight UTC." is correct but 
terse ...)

I have no idea how to get readxl::read_excel to import a timestamp column in a timezone. It is true that Excel has no concept of timezones, but the data one finds there usually came from a text file at some point. Importing as character is a feasible strategy, but trying to convince an intermediate user to go to that much trouble is a headache when the issue is ignored in the help file.

It is evidently possible to specify a locale input to readr::read_csv, but the default behaviour guesses timestamp columns and assumes "UTC", and a file may contain data from different timezones (UTC and local civil are a common combination). Again, character import and manual conversion are needed.

It has been quite a bit different in R-devel  for a little
while.  NEWS entries  (there are more already, and more coming
on the wide topic)

    * The as.POSIXlt(<POSIXlt>) and as.POSIXct(<POSIXct>) default
      methods now do obey their tz argument, also in this case.

    * as.POSIXlt(<Date>) now does apply a tz (timezone) argument, as
      does as.POSIXct(); partly suggested by Roland Fuss on the R-devel
      mailing list.

and indeed it would have been good had you used (and read) the
R-devel mailing list  which is much more appropriate on the
topic of *changing* base R behavior.

?Matrix::sparse.model.matrix seems to recommend
MatrixModel::model.Matrix for this reason. The latter function returns
an object with additional slots `assign` and `contrasts`, which should
make it possible to recover the original columns.

Dear members,

I have difficulties packing my OpenCL functions together as a complete R
package. I did not find any exemplary R package building upon the R
OpenCL Package. Currently I can only run the OpenCL functions as was
presented by the OpenCL examples of the OpenCL package itself. So,

I?m not particularly experienced with this but wrote a ?proof-of-concept? skeleton of a package at https://github.com/mtmorgan/ocl . The basics are


  *   Import OpenCL in the DESCRIPTION file
  *   Write OpenCL scripts in inst/ (dnorm implemented in OpenCL)
  *   Use the helper function in R/ocl.R to source the code
  *   Provide a user-friendly interface as in R/examples.R (dnorm_ocl)

Dear members,

I have difficulties packing my OpenCL functions together as a complete R
package. I did not find any exemplary R package building upon the R
OpenCL Package. Currently I can only run the OpenCL functions as was
presented by the OpenCL examples of the OpenCL package itself. So,
assuming I have working OpenCL files, how can I create the MakeVars (or
whatever necessity needs to be done), in order to create a fully
functional R package?

<SNIP>

Here is some advice based on our experience in splitting the
'spatstat' package (over 170,000 lines of code, now split into 10
sub-packages, which took us about one person-year of work).

See https://github.com/spatstat/spatstat.

1. Don't split your package unless you must.

Splitting a package into sub-packages takes considerable effort.
Maintaining a set of sub-packages requires much more effort than
maintaining a single large package.  We estimate, quasi-seriously,
that the amount of effort required is O(n^2) where n is the number
of sub-packages.  :-)

If you split a package, the CRAN servers will have less work, but
almost everyone else --- developers, maintainers, CRAN team, users
--- will have more work.  You won't even reduce the number of emails
from CRAN: the R package checker complains when a package is large,
but it also complains when the package Depends on many sub-packages.

2. Design the split.

Do not start tinkering until you have a plan.  Print out a list
of the functions (or the R files and help files) in your package,
and think about a simple rule for splitting/grouping them.

The rule for splitting the package needs to be simple and easy
to apply for developers and users.  For example in spatstat we
separated 'exploratory' statistical summaries from 'parametric'
statistical models because we can all remember what that means.
(Note that *users* have to ?apply? the splitting rule in order
to know where to find/look for a particular function after the
package has been split.)

A good splitting rule is something to do with the fundamental purpose
of each function.  The amount of trouble you will have after the
split is related to the number of dependencies (between functions)
that cross these boundaries, and the easiest way to minimise this
is to group the functions according to their fundamental purpose.

Give plenty of notice to the maintainers of packages that depend
on your package.

3. Use 'make' and 'filepp' to implement the split.

Leave the original source files where they are.  Maintain the
original source files as the master copies (i.e. bug fixes are
fixed in these original files).

For each sub-package, set up a new folder/directory with a Makefile
that copies selected source files from the original package into
the new directory.  The Makefile can include rules that invoke
'filepp' to filter the source files. Arguments to the 'filepp' call
can specify the names of variables that will then be substituted
into the source code, or used as variables in 'if/then' directives
to switch on/off blocks of code.  This setup makes it much easier
to keep track of the fate of each file, and to change your mind
if needed.

The "make" tool is extremely powerful and useful, and is ubiquitously
applied by software developers.  However its syntax is not perspicuous,
and can be daunting until you become experienced.  If you are not
completely comfortable with "make" you might find the tutorials at

    https://makefiletutorial.com

and

    https://cs.colby.edu/maxwell/courses/tutorials/maketutor

to be helpful.

For information on filepp see https://www-users.york.ac.uk/~dm26/filepp

4. Do the split offline.

Develop the sub-packages on your own machine until they all pass
the package checker.

5.  Consider the sequence of steps to get the packages on CRAN.

CRAN has no mechanism for submitting a set of packages at the
same time.  Each submission is checked individually, on several
different servers, using several versions of R, using the packages
that are installed on that server.  Hence the submission of your new
sub-packages must be carried out according to a carefully considered
incremental process.

Problems that can occur include:

a. Incompatibility between your new submission and the packages
currently on the particular  server.

b. Cycles (loops) in the dependence graph.  The dependence between
functions in the packages may include loops where A depends on B
which depends on C which depends on A, etc.

c. Hard crashes.  Crashes can occur if you use compiled functions
(e.g. C language) or if your package is byte-compiled.  In either
case, changes to the interface (argument sequence) of compiled or
byte-compiled code in one sub-package can result in an error or
hard crash when another sub-package tries to call a function using
the wrong interface.

There is no sure way to prevent these happening.  The best defence
is to use the version number dependency rules in the DESCRIPTION
file (to prevent the use of incompatible packages), and to allow
about a week for each submitted package to propagate through the
CRAN testing network (to ensure that the latest versions are used).

Despite this, you can expect to have correspondence with CRAN about
such problems.

Allow plenty of time between submitting successive sub-packages.
Give plenty of notice to users and maintainers of dependent packages.

Hope this helps.

cheers,

Rolf Turner (on behalf of Adrian Baddeley and Ege Rubak)

P.S.  I hope that this posting is not too late to be useful.  The
lateness is entirely the fault of Rolf Turner.

Does it help to remove the NEWS after you've created NEWS.md in the
root directory of your package? In theory, NEWS.md takes precedence
over everything except inst/NEWS.Rd, but maybe that's not the case when
checking the package.

For the record, both the plain text format R expects in the NEWS file
and the Markdown format for NEWS.md are described in help(news).

Message-ID: <03D1BB9F-72A9-48BD-9CCB-E94F370027B5@noaa.gov>

Hi All:

About a week ago I received a notice that my package 'rerddapXtracto' was failing nightly builds and i needed to fix it or face being archived.  Fair enough.  The next day I submitted a fix.  My package has one example that always comes in just above the time that is checked for.  That this is so is in the CRAN notes.

After I got the note that the new package failed the automated test for this reason,  I responded with this fact and asked it to be reconsidered, as it has been in the past.  Since then,  I have sent two more reminders with no response.  I realize CRAN folks are pretty busy,  but I really don't want the package removed from CRAN,  so am mainly hoping this email will give a little nudge,  or if people have other suggestions.

Thanks,

-Roy

The file GB_zeroin.c is saved in Latin-1 encoding. The warning should
go away once you convert it to UTF-8.

Thanks Ivan,

I found two simple ways to convert this old file to UTF-8:

(i) In emacs, C-x <RET> f <RET> (default is utf-8)

(ii) In RStudio, set Tools-Global Options-Code-Saving-
Default text encoding  to UTF-8

No problem with new files.

Hello,

Grateful if you could please help with the following comments:

Please add small executable examples in your Rd-files to illustrate the
use of the exported function but also enable automatic testing.

The greymodels package loads data from spreadsheets and each model accepts
a set of data and outputs the fitted and
predicted values. For instance, to load data and model it using the EPGM
(1; 1) model, we follow
Univariate Models > Background Values > EPGM (1; 1) model > Data Input

How do I incorporate that into executable examples?

Thanks and regards,
Havisha

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Error when install binary from CRAN but not if
 install from source - Macintoh, lme4, Matrix, buildmer
Message-ID: <CADtpigZfFG8oNO0NF2g6tku2whAFL2ycF_2JbWSL=AGkRf2F5w@mail.gmail.com>

I've run into a problem where if you install the lme4, Matrix, and buildmer
packages using the binaries from CRAN on a Mac, I get an error message
about a missing method, but if I install the same packages from SOURCE, the
code runs fine.

I would have thought that installing from source or using the binary
should look the same.

Any suggestions on how to proceed to resolve this issue?

The maintainer of buildmer is also puzzled.
You can follow the issue in more detail at:
    https://github.com/cvoeten/buildmer/issues/20

This is way above my paygrade...

Carl Schwarz

------------------------------------------------------

Tried this on an intel-Mac and arm-Mac with the same result.
Works fine on Windows machines under both scenarios.

Here is a test example

library(buildmer)
library(lme4)

nrow <- 100

test <- data.frame(x01=runif(nrow),
                   y=runif(nrow)<.1, block=as.factor(floor((1:nrow)/50)))
head(test)


fit.model <- lme4::glmer(y~x01 + (1|block), data=test,
                   family=binomial(link="logit"))
fit.model # this works

class(fit.model)

summary(fit.model)
# gives the following error message
Error in diag(from, names = FALSE) : object 'dgeMatrix_getDiag' not found

A pdf document showing output is attached (shows the sessionInfo etc).

When you install the buildmer and Matrix packages from SOURCE, it runs fine.

I've tried all combinations of installing binary/source and only if both
packages (Matrix and buidmer) are installed from source, does the code run.

Same issue on an intel-Mac.
Same issue when running under the R directly rather than Rstudio on a Mac.

I see the same thing.  This sounds like a problem in the handling of 
methods that has been discussed somewhat recently:

   https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2022-September/081971.html

The problem is that when the binary is built, some code from other 
packages is kept as part of it.  When that other package is updated, you 
need a new source install of your own package (or a rebuild at CRAN to 
replace the binary) to cache the new code.

This can also be done explicitly by package startup code; I think this 
thread

   https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-package-devel/2022q3/008481.html

turned out to be a case where rstan was caching something, and an update 
to ggplot2 didn't work with the cached data.  Given the error message, 
your issue sounds more like the first one.

I don't recall if there was a resolution.  Maybe you can ask the CRAN 
maintainers to rebuild buildmer.

Incidentally, he's G?ran on a DK keyboard but G?ran on an NO one. The three Scandinavian languages have the same three extra letters (???), but Swedish writes the former two with diaeresis (like German), reverses their order in the alphabet (???), and switches ? and ? on the keyboard (compared to Danish, that is). Norwegian writes and sorts like Danish, but has the same key reversion as Swedish. "Brotherly love"...

Actually, the order is ??? (Swedish). Didn't know about the different
Scandinavian alphabetical orderings, thanks for the info!

Yes, thank you, Duncan!

The binary version of 'builmer' (or also lme4 ?) must have been created
with an older version of Matrix  (which did not have the
dgeMatrix_getDiag C code)  and the respective maintainer of the
binary builds (*) must rebuild the binary versions of those
Matrix-reverse-dependant packages,
---
*) in this case the macOS ones (both for Intel and ARM Macs)

Please let the Simon (Mac maintainer for CRAN) know.
For Windows, the revdeps get rebuild automatically.

It seems that this could be mostly avoided if instead of caching copies 
of Matrix methods when buildmer was installed, R would cache promises to 
get those methods.  Then if the method for some particular signature 
changed, on first use buildmer would retrieve the current version.

There would still be a problem if Matrix completely dropped a method or 
it migrated to a different package, but I think that's less frequent 
than a change to the internal implementation.

Has any thought been given to making this change for R 4.3.0?

Dear all at R-package-devel,

I am struggling with a R package build.
It builds fine on my mac, which is my usual work environment. But when I
submit to CRAN, while the windows version is fine, the debian version fails
with a cryptic message:

It is painful to debug because I don't have a debian machine. Furthermore
the issue seems to be in the file called at line 22 of gsl_math.sh which is
#include <math.h>
These are rather arcane (to me) building blocks of C and I don't get why it
would suddenly create some issue on Debian (but not on mac or windows).

My issue is perhaps that I copied substantial amount of the GSL library (as
opposed to using it as dependency) but it would be painful to do otherwise
now (this is an old package that has started to complain only recently).

Any and all advice is welcome to help me interpret what I see here.

Thanks,

Vincent

You could install VirtualBox if you wanted to test it yourself, or if you
have the tarball available online somewhere, I can try building it.

For what it's worth, I couldn't reproduce the problem when compiling
VP_gamma.c from https://github.com/vplagnol/ExomeDepth on two of my
Debian machines with older GCC versions; you might actually need GCC 12
to see it.

I see that VP_gamma.c includes config.h before including gsl_math.h.
Typically, config.h should be automatically generated by the configure
script and may contain different definitions on different systems.
Somebody else has a similar problem, also in math.h, also with a file
that includes config.h before math.h:
https://github.com/vplagnol/ExomeDepth/issues/50

I think that config.h defines something in its /* Substitute gsl
functions for missing system functions */ section that confuses the
glibc math.h machinery. If you have to include config.h in a source
file, it might help to process the system headers first.

I had a related problem recently: MinGW was complaining about a
strftime call in bundled code that wasn't reachable from R anyway, so I
decided to patch it out using the preprocessor. The correct way to do
so is to #include the system header first, then re-#define the function
to nothing:
https://github.com/aitap/Ropj/commit/a7d6cec19d11d47d731fbadbf8735660e534efaa

Otherwise the re-definition affects the system header where the
function is declared and the result is syntactically invalid.

Not that I know of.

It sounds like a very promising (pun! ;-) idea, that could solve
many subtle  inter-package installation/update  problems.

Note that the methods *and* classes  caching had been introduced
a longer while ago as part of a concerted effort to make the
loading of packages with (many) S4 methods and classes considerably faster.

Before that effort, all these class and method "tables"/"lists"
(environments effectively) were (re-)computed at package load
time which was quite costly [time consuming].
I was not very much involved in that effort and I don't know if
using promises instead had been considered at the time.

(I've added Michael and the other Martin M to the CC , hoping
 they will know / remember more )

Message-ID: <CALcKxsq1EYdsSh3i2MPLop8fxngVpAKfY8ZqMCmbG+k280VJoA@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

In my CDatanet package, I want to print texts and values during a numerical
optimization process. I saw in many posts that CRAN is not happy with
sd::cout and sd::endl. What I understood is that it is better to use Rcpp
functions. So I used:

Rcpp::Rcout << "beta: \n";
Rcpp::print(betacpp);
Rcpp::Rcout << "log-likelihood: " << llh << "\n";

Everything is fine with the check --as-cran with Linux and Windows.
However, there is a warning with Mac (
https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-release-macos-arm64/CDatanet-00check.html
)
checking compiled code ... WARNING
File ?CDatanet/libs/CDatanet.so?:
  Found ?___assert_rtn?, possibly from ?assert? (C)
    Objects: ?CDincomInfo.o?, ?CDincomInfo.rho.o?, ?Homophily.o?,
      ?RcppExports.o?, ?SARTIncomplet.o?

Compiled code should not call entry points which might terminate R nor
write to stdout/stderr instead of to the console, nor use Fortran I/O
nor system RNGs.

I think this is because I am printing from C++ functions. Am I wrong? If
not, what is the best way to print in the console from C++ functions?

No, this is not related to the use of printing functions. It seems to
be related to RcppEigen according to this:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70415854/helps-on-the-package-development

On Linux, I don't see ___assert_rtn being included in the final shared
library (this seems to happen only for macOS for some reason). What I
did find in the shared library is this:

(internal::UIntPtr(eigen_unaligned_array_assert_workaround_gcc47(array))
& (15)) == 0 && "this assertion is explained here: "
"http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox-devel/group__TopicUnalignedArrayAssert.html"
" **** READ THIS WEB PAGE !!! ****"

Not sure if this is related to the issue you see, but it seems likely.

This seems to be a right way of printing from Rcpp code.

Since you don't call assert() yourself (which, in theory, shouldn't
matter as R packages are compiled with #define NDEBUG), it must be one
of the C++ template classes you're using. They may contain calls to
assert() or an equivalent, which get inlined inside your binary during
compilation. It might be even inside the implementation of the C++
standard library, which would be completely outside your control.

I'm not sure, but it could be possible to explain this situation to
CRAN as a false-positive. In order to find out further, you'll need
someone with a macOS computer or experience in cross-platform
development to either disassemble the existing binary or take the
compilation pipeline apart in order to find out where the calls to
___assert_rtn originate.

Yup!

And as stated that alone does not cause `__assert_rtn` or many of the now
almost 2600 Rcpp-using packages (that print this way) would have issues.

Thank you very much for your answers.

I finally noticed that the issue comes from the numerical optimization, in which I use the class MFuncGrad of the package RcppNumerical. Is there any problem in using this class? This is the only way I know to compute integrals of perform numerical optimizations in Rcpp. The other way might be: construct the function to be minimized in Rcpp and use the function optim in R. But this is not efficient.

Best,
Aristide

Thank you Andrew for offering to help. The R-hub package sorted me out for
testing for various OSs.

And Ivan: thank you very much- you were spot on. Swapping the order of
config.h and system headers in all my C files made the compilation work in
my R-hub tests. Hopefully ExomeDepth is now about to show up in CRAN (I
just resubmitted). Amazingly insightful advice. I think it's fair to say
that I would never have worked that one out (or it would have taken me
absolutely forever). So thanks a lot for helping, I am really grateful.

And noted re replying in plain text. Gmail does HTML without really telling
that it does HTML but I'll try to stick to plain text in the future.

That package is also used by others [1] and you should maybe study their code
and setup as it seems unlikely to me that your woes are due to
RcppNumerical. It likely is a simple inadvertent issue in your package.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Frictionless alternative for `-Wstrict-prototypes`
Message-ID: <CAJf4E3pCqzbdpTaVWZyS1b9xntge+5nsQ0kS47UBwqjxUzNpqQ@mail.gmail.com>

Davis Vaughan and I were looking into the `-Wstrict-prototypes`
warnings for C code that were recently added to the R-devel checks. We
did a little research and found that these warnings are intended to
catch old-style definitions and declarations that were deprecated a
long time ago. This includes:

1. Unspecified types like `void fn(x, y);`
2. Unspecified parameter lists like `void fn();`.

We also found:

- That only unspecified types (case 1) will become defunct. For
  unspecified parameter lists (case 2), it was announced recently that
  the C standard committee has decided to simply change the meaning to
  "no arguments" in C23. This aligns with what most people think it
  means, and is what C++ does. See item 13 of page 130 in the C23
  working draft at https://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n3054.pdf.

- The new `-Wdeprecated-non-prototype` option for clang-15 does not
  warn for empty parameter lists, allowing for a smooth transition
  that allows this widespread usage.

Since the no arguments case is both incredibly common and will become
fully legal C syntax in a close future, it seems it might not be worth
it to require all packages to update their code to an intermediary
form that reads less well, is not as intuitive to most people (and so
might crop up back in further updates), and will become standard in
the future anyway.

Perhaps a good course of action would be:

- Using `-Wno-strict-prototypes` to disable the stringent checks.

- Enabling the new `-Wdeprecated-non-prototype` in clang to catch
  old-style definitions and declarations.

This way CRAN would be able to catch deprecated syntax while allowing
the soon-to-be-legal syntax of empty parameter lists. We hope that
this would mean less code churn on CRAN, which means less work for the
CRAN maintainers as well as for the maintainers of CRAN packages.

Best,
Lionel & Davis

Yes, the resubmission and re-building has fixed the problem with buildmer/

Message-ID: <CAJiVmSCzHPR3+AP=7s-USjo2RG2OvP7cfhB=rTdMq3+prbjQXA@mail.gmail.com>

I published the R Package AQLSChemes on CRAN in May 2022. The book "An
Introduction to Acceptance Sampling and SPC with R" was published after
that, and included examples of the use of AQLSChemes package. Since then, I
have retired and was not aware that the AQLSChemes package was removed
from CRAN.  When I try to run code from the book  that requires the
AQLSChemes package, I get the message that the package doesn't exist.

My question is, How can I find out why the package AQLSChemes was removed
from CRAN, and what do I need to do to restore it to CRAN?

Sincerely

As Roy Mendelssohn has pointed out, AQLSChemes is there on CRAN.

Perhaps you need to re-install it on your machine.

Whoops!  I neglected to note the crucial fact that it's "AQLSchemes"
--- lower case "c".  Makes all the difference!

The capital does not matter for CRAN, packages may not be published if an
existing package exists by the same name, regardless of case.

Plus, the package at https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=AQLSchemes says the
maintainer is John Lawson

Hello all,

Our package did not pass the automagical checks when submitted to CRAN. We think the rejection is a false positive, so we ?reply-all to that message and explain? as following the official instruction. We provided explanation for all notes in that email (replied to cran-submissions at r-project.org<mailto:cran-submissions at r-project.org>) but did not receive any message after 9 days.

I am looking for suggestions on what to do in this case: should we continue waiting for CRAN team?s reply? Or is it necessary to eliminate those notes and then submit the package again?

Below are the notes from CRAN teams' auto-check service and our explanation send to CRAN team:

Explain:  This is because a large dataset is used in the example. An example with large dataset is necessary, as this package is meant for analyzing large datasets.

This is definitely not a false positive. Find a way to not run long calcs during the CRAN build. There is no alternative.

One way this can be done is by only running your examples when an environment variable of your choosing exists. Since CRAN machines won't configure that variable, you can get around this hard requirement.

I run into this all the time.  The trick is to find a minimal example that the package will work with that shows how to make a call,  and allows for CRAN, especially on new submissions,  to test to some extent that the function works.  For more real-life examples,  write a good vignette that uses the larger dataset,  but remember that the build of the vignette also has a time limit, I think it is 10 minutes but don't quote me on that.

I may mis-state this a little,  but I believe CRAN does a nightly build of the entire environment.  If things take too long,  the build would never finish.  I am certain there are several reasons for doing this,  but one reason is to attempt to insure that all packages work together so that they will work when you install them into your environment.  As compared to another,  unnamed language where even using the package manager I have had to trash the entire environment due to inconsistencies, so packages wouldn't load. Once even after a clean install and an "update all",  several major packages wouldn't load due to inconsistencies.  If that ever has happened in R I don't remember it,  and why I go to the trouble to get my packages into CRAN,  because a lot of users just want things to work when they install the package,  and CRAN helps with that.

HTH,

-Roy

Wrapping with \donttest{} may help here. Despite the name, CMD check 
--as-cran *will* run these tests, but will not be subject to the same 
time restrictions.

On submission of your package, the examples will be run with and without 
\donttest{}. However, the periodic (daily?) checks that get run skip the 
\donttest{} checks, to keep the CPU time these require manageable, and 
this is what the NOTE is about.

    > Cheers,

Sorry to be blunt but I think only Roy's is good here:
Make a small data example even though the package is for large
data ... maybe adding a comment about the really large data
example, in a vignette or possibly simply commented out (or \donttest{..}).

Do - by all means - have examples in your code  which run --
also always on CRAN.
\donttest{} or some sneaky tricks to circumenvent CRAN checks
running the example are only cheap workarounds, but not really
good.

Reasons:
- Users new to your package may just want to try a new
  function  via   example(<your_function>)   {or nowadays also
  clicking "Run example" in some setups}

  I do tend to misttrust (or worse) packages which do nothing in
  a such case.

- When we, as R Core, consider tweaking / changing R we do
  sometimes in advance and the CRAN processes do very regularly
  run all the checks of all CRAN with "R-devel", the development
  version and hence potential "next version" of R.
  Your package's example will be run (if they are ..!) and you
  as package author may be notified well in advance should the
  examples stop running.


With regards,
Martin

Message-ID: <C6BE8AAE-92A0-4FD4-9224-C316E1D60314@nbenn.ch>

Dear list

Trying to push a fix to CRAN, I?m now running into a Latex issue. I can neither relate the issue I?m trying to resolve, nor my fix, to this new problem, so I?m a bit lost (and slightly frustrated).

I cannot reproduce this specific issue anywhere, neither locally (macOS), nor on win devel, r-hub and Github (there are some other issues on Gh and r-hub, but I don?t believe them to be relevant here).

All I have to go on is:

- A WARNING in ?checking PDF version of manual?: LaTeX errors found: ! Package pdftex.def Error: File `...' not found: using draft setting.
- An ERROR in ?checking PDF version of manual without index?
- A NOTE in ?checking for non-standard things in the check directory?: Found the following files/directories: ?...-manual.tex?

It seems like when building the PDF manual, an image that should be included is not found and then things fall apart, causing both the error and note. For all I know, the image should be there unter `man/figures/`.

The problem is showing up in the same way for both ?Windows? and ?Debian? (with slightly different notes due to intermediate files not being cleaned up properly).

Have there been and Latex-related changes to CRAN recently? Are others seeing similar problems? Any ideas what could be causing this?

For completeness: https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/ricu_0.5.4_20221030_131320/

Is it the following change?

https://github.com/eth-mds/ricu/commit/b4ac31a2cc22da236e56ce9875b2d799ae172d46

The updated Rd file now says "\figure{man/figures/sofa-sep-3-1.png}".
According to WRE 2.7, paths to the figures should be specified relative
to man/figures. In other words, in order to reference
man/figures/sofa-sep-3-1.png, use \figure{sofa-sep-3-1.png}.

Message-ID: <d01a36ff-d779-41cc-b3b7-df2414d8cbaf@app.fastmail.com>

Hi,

I'm looking for advice on how to resurrect an archived R package.

I have a couple of scripts that rely on the CC0-licensed BIS package (https://cran.r-project.org/package=BIS) which downloads and parses data from the Bank for International Settlements. The package was archived in 2021, presumably because the format of the source data changed which I imagine caused examples to fail. Writing code to digest the new data format is straightforward, so I'd like to bring the package back. Unfortunately I'm unable to reach the original author, so I'm unsure how to proceed.

Does CRAN allow for people other than the original author to bring back a package? Or would it be preferable to create a new package with a new name? In either case, how would the original package author be acknowledged?

Thanks,
Stefan

According to the CRAN policy [*], it should be possible to submit the
fixed package under the original name with an explanation that the
previous maintainer is unavailable:

>> Explain any change in the maintainer?s email address and if possible
>> send confirmation from the previous address (by a separate email to
>> CRAN-submissions at R-project.org) or explain why it is not possible.

Disclaimer: I've never done this myself.

For the record, the author's GitHub and Twitter accounts are trivial to
find; there is a bit of activity in the former (only once in 2022), and
the last update in the latter was in 2020.

> In either case, how would the original package author be acknowledged?

Make sure to mention Eric Persson in the Authors: field of the
DESCRIPTION file as a full author, but not the maintainer.

You will also need to make sure that the examples never crash, even if
there's no connection to the Internet, which may have been part of the
original reason the package had been archived.

Well, we run these on CRAN from time to time, but R CMD check --as-cran 
does not run them.

I dom not believe you need a large data frame for the examples: The 
exanmples are intended to show users how you call the function and pass 
the arguments. You do not need to demonstrate that you can run it on 
huge data, as your users don't want to wait for hours in order to see 
the principles of the function call ....

Best,
Uwe Ligges

 R
Message-ID: <CAPcHnpTdWg4H8a0n3emLBJgdHVZQBVW+BPi75wV4iX-GnNfm8w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,


I had some R code for dealing with connections, and I was using
summary.connection(). I rewrote it in C, so I was doing something more
like:

#include <R_ext/Connections.h>

Rconnection Rcon = R_GetConnection(file);
Rcon->description or Rcon->class

but now, when checking my package, I get the following note:

* checking compiled code ... NOTE
File 'this.path/libs/x64/this.path.dll':
  Found non-API call to R: 'R_GetConnection'

Compiled code should not call non-API entry points in R.

See 'Writing portable packages' in the 'Writing R Extensions' manual.

This isn't surprising, <R_ext/Connections.h> (seen here:
https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/50ff41b742a1ac655314be5e25897a12d3096661/src/include/R_ext/Connections.h#L21)
says that it is not part of the R API, and later on says that it is
subject to change without notice or backwards compatibility.

R_GetConnection was added in R 3.3.0, so I added "Depends: R (>=
3.3.0)" to my DESCRIPTION, then I added something like this to my
header:

#if !defined(R_CONNECTIONS_VERSION)
    #error why is R_CONNECTIONS_VERSION not defined????
#elif R_CONNECTIONS_VERSION == 1
    extern Rconnection R_GetConnection(SEXP sConn);
#else
    #error this.path is only implemented for R_CONNECTIONS_VERSION 1
#endif

but the NOTE still remains. I think I've taken all the precautions I
can, is there anything more I can do? Will I be unable to submit the
update for my package? Will the CRAN team ignore the NOTE if I explain
the precautions I added?

The R API is owned by R Core. So they can do as they please.

And so they do as they are acutely aware of the cost of maintaining an
'enlarged surface'. And they try to keep it small. Understandably so.

Some of us package developers have asked for more interfaces. Repeatedly so
for connections for what is (likely already, else soon) twenty years. Alas...

Then there is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_software_engineering
so eventually we run out of patience.

Hence, as both trial baloons as well as intial use case I published two packages
  RApiDatetime    exposing some unexported datetime conversion
  RApiSerialize   exposing some (basic) connections facilities

RApiSerialize really owes a Thank You! to RhpcBLASctl as Junji and Ei-ji
showed me the way of what one could do here.

Now, do I think these packages are the best answer? Far from it. Vendoring,
as done here, casts existing interfaces (and behavior) in conrete. It is less
than ideal. The code can atrophy. But it provides access when those who own
the access refuse to provide it (for what remain defensible reasons).

All told, not ideal either way. But venues for workarounds exist. So
sometimes they are taken. Because we can. Just look for the least-evil way.

When a public C interface is missing you could always load and call the R
interface.

Definitely slower, but the API will be more stable than when vendoring (and
CRAN will be happier).

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Examples with CPU time is greater than elapsed time.

Hi all,

I tried to submit an update to the xgboost package but didn't pass the 
pre-tests with the following note (solved the other one, but this one is 
a bit confusing):

```
Flavor: r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-gcc
Check: examples, Result: NOTE
   Examples with CPU time > 2.5 times elapsed time
                        user system elapsed ratio
   cb.gblinear.history 1.454  0.017    0.49 3.002

```

I can't reproduce the note on win-builder: 
https://win-builder.r-project.org/ as it's running on Windows but the 
note appears on debian tests. I'm not able to reproduce it on my local 
machine either with Ubuntu 22.04. I'm wondering what the note is trying 
to tell me and how can I resolve it with confidence.


The full log is here: 
https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/xgboost_1.7.1.1_20221104_194252/Debian/00check.log 
.


Many thanks!

I think it's because it suggests that the package uses more than 250%
of CPU load on average, which suggests it runs in parallel with more
than two parallel workers, which is the upper limit in the CRAN
Policies (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html);

"If running a package uses multiple threads/cores it must never use
more than two simultaneously: the check farm is a shared resource and
will typically be running many checks simultaneously. "

>From the R Internals
(https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-ints.html):

"_R_CHECK_EXAMPLE_TIMING_CPU_TO_ELAPSED_THRESHOLD_: For checks with
timings enabled, report examples where the ratio of CPU time to
elapsed time exceeds this threshold (and the CPU time is at least one
second). This can help detect the simultaneous use of multiple CPU
cores. Default: NA."

It looks like CRAN incoming sets
_R_CHECK_EXAMPLE_TIMING_CPU_TO_ELAPSED_THRESHOLD_=2.5.

If multi-threading is involved, I guess you need to make sure to limit
it to ~2 parallel threads.

Henrik Bengtsson already gave a good explanation of the problem.

Not sure what exactly is the right thing to do, but one way to get rid
of this warning could be to pass the argument nthread =
min(parallel::detectCores(), 2) to the xgb.cv invocation (if you
already use the parallel package anywhere) or maybe to hard-code the
use of only one thread in the example.

Message-ID: <CAARY7kiaUcEpf3h3eCbA=cOZaDJCsY-s-YqWScz4DTALu9eC3Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm considering submitting the package onetime (
https://github.com/hughjonesd/onetime/) to CRAN.

Onetime has functions for showing a message or warning only once (ever per
user). It does this by writing to a file in the user's configuration
directory, as reported by rappdirs::user_config_dir().

I know that CRAN has rules about not writing to the user's file system
without permission. What would be an appropriate way to do this? For
example, the function onetime_message_confirm() prints a message and then
asks "Show this again?[yN]" Would a "no" count as permission to write the
file?

Cheers,
David

There is a base R function tools::R_user_dir() which I use in a few packages
along with packageName() to store config information across sessions. A quick
search at GitHub's 'cran' org mirroring CRAN finds 110 hits:

   https://github.com/search?q=org%3Acran+R_user_dir&type=code

You could keep a hashmap in that directory, and maybe (before it has been
written a first time) alert the user that you cannot write without (initial)
permission.  As I recall, the idea behind the (sensible) CRAN Policy is to
not litter user directories with random files with the user knowing.

Thank you for the suggestions! I think I will hard-code the number of 
threads to 2 in that specific example.

Further to Dirk's advice, my BrailleR package creates a folder (dumping ground). Users are asked if they want to use  one of my choosing, or a temporary one. If they choose temporary, they get asked again and again until they cave in to my wishes!


BrailleR also writes files to the current working directory, but these are done because the user has chosen to run a command that has the purpose of creating files. I put a warning in the documentation for such functions.

I'm not suggesting my solution is the gold standard, but it is working well enough to keep the CRAN checkers happy.

Thank you both. I guess the package can dog food itself by asking one time
whether it can store its files.

Message-ID: <CAKU6PFWwf4ejwFOxDuBTVnwkSwkdyCuVUy3KeO9hrKv9DugRLg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear CRAN team,

The package 'Greymodels' has just been published on CRAN. After loading the
package on CRAN, when I try to upload file (xlsx or xls)
the following error appears:

Error: cannot open the connection

What could be the problem? Is it because of the working directory?

Please advise on how to fix this.

Many thanks,
Havisha Jahajeeah

Do you mean uploading files into your Shiny application, or somewhere
else?

Have you tried following this guide?

Thank you for the reply.

Yes, uploading files into the Shiny app.

The Greymodels package loads data from spreadsheets and each model accepts
a set of data and outputs the  values. However, the package is unable to do
that because of the error: cannot open connection.

Regards,
Havisha

Thank you for clarifying the problem!

The guide at https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/debugging.html is full
of useful things to try when a Shiny app is misbehaving. I could try to
write an instruction for you to follow here, but it would end up being
a paraphrase of this guide. If you follow the guide, you should be able
to find out (1) which of your read_excel calls is failing, (2) what is
its argument and (3) what actually ends up at that path at the time of
the call. Once you know this information, the solution may become
obvious, or at least there may be something for us to give you more
pointers about.

While there is a chance that someone else will come along, run your
package on their machine and reproduce the problem, there's also a
significant chance that no one will do that. Meanwhile, these steps are
relatively simple and may help you solve the problem right away.

as ratio is > 2.5 it looks like you are using multiple threads or

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] cross-ref possible ext.pkg's --not mentioned in
 DESCRIPTION file-- in non-code sections in .Rd files
Message-ID: <4093b254-b157-3a90-9dfc-b28692ca0247@web.de>

Hi,

triggered by some new NOTEs uncovering infallacities in my packages on CRAN, I stumbled upon

Result: NOTE ????Undeclared packages ?distrMod?, ?RobAStBase? in Rd xrefs

which is issued in R-devel-linux-x86_64-fedora-clang (but not otherwise).

Digging into it, this comes from a text in a \seealso section where through something like

\code{\{link}[<ext.pkg>]{<generic>}

we want to link to a method provided in some extension package <ext.pkg> for a generic
<generic> documented in Rd-file of the current package.

In this case, we intentionally do not have <ext.pkg> in any of the entries "Depends", "Suggests",
"Imports", "Enhances" in the DESCRIPTION file, as <ext.pkg> is neither needed visible for the
user, nor for the code in the current package nor for testing code nor for example code and vignettes
of the current package, and because having it in "Suggests" would produce a circular dependence
as <ext.pkg> has the current package in its "Imports" section.

Of course, in "Writing R extesions" we find that

"Packages referred to by these ?other forms? should be declared in the DESCRIPTION file, in
 ? the ?Depends?, ?Imports?, ?Suggests? or ?Enhances? fields. "

so I am aware that this is my fault, as I use these 'other forms'? without declaration in the DESCRIPTION file.
Now I guess I could wrap my conditional cross-ref into some R-code, testing whether <ext.pkg> is available,
i.e., something like

\Sexpr[eval=TRUE,stage=render,results=text]{if("<ext.pkg>" %in% installed.packages()[,1] )
 ?cat("\\code{\\{link}[<ext.pkg>]{<generic>}") else cat("<generic> from package \\pkg{<ext.pkg>})

and so produce the link only if <ext.pkg> is installed at rendering time, but I would guess such a
conditional linkage would be something which could be of interest to a broader scope of R-package
developers and hence could and should be implemented in a less cumbersome, and more
efficient way.

Any suggestions welcome,
best, Peter

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] CRAN index replaces ampersand in BugReports URL with
 HTML entity
Message-ID: <19ef97af-5f05-26ee-8667-7c3f091543e0@gmail.com>

Hello,

It was raised on the Matrix bug tracker [1] that the BugReports URL
on the CRAN index [2] is broken.  The URL in our DESCRIPTION file [3]
is fine, but contains an ampersand, which is improperly replaced with
the corresponding HTML entity in the HTML sources of the index.

Hence this does not affect bug.report(package="Matrix"), but _does_
make our bug tracker inaccessible to people accustomed to visiting
the CRAN page for links.

Can this be repaired?

Mikael

Packages in Suggests and Enhances do not create a circular dependency, only
the packages in the Depends and Imports need to be installed at INSTALL and
loaded at load time. Packages in Suggests and Enhances are only needed at
check time, and even then it's more of a desire to be loaded than actually
needing to be loaded.

I would just put them in Suggests or Enhances

Thank you, Andrew.

'Enhances'  I think would be preferable.

Still, as Peter, I am not very happy about this NOTE.
Notably as I guess people will use (even) less \link{..} in
their R documentation (*).

... but yes, we can live with it, and I'm sure Peter will keep
his Rd files well maintained in spite ..

Martin


--
*) which is often lacking anyway, in my view
   because things like roxygen implicitly/indirectly suggest to

Message-ID: <CAHTZEhAicFU8iqJui5QrOSfGkqx7y1ZgMh=R=i3hPM7yZmy2oQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Are there any current recommendations on integrating Rust (and Cargo, its
official package manager) in an R package complying to CRAN's policies?

To be clear: This question is not about how to integrate Rust in the
package, it is about how to do it without creating friction with the CRAN
team and infrastructure. I want to write the Rust-C-R interface and build
scripts myself.

To me, Rust seems like a very good fit for R interop as it has a native C
FFI, and has address and UB safety guarantees that top the strictest C++
compiler warnings. However Rust's standard library is very small by design,
so Cargo integration would be needed.

I know there is:

- rextendr (https://cran.r-project.org/package=rextendr):
I don't think there is a package using this on CRAN yet.

- cargo-framework (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cargo)
Removed from CRAN.

- r-rust/gifski (https://cran.r-project.org/package=gifski)
Downloads precompiled binaries on windows for CRAN (which is, as I
understand it, strongly discouraged for a number of reasons:
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2022-September/082027.html).

Thank you very much for your time,
Florian

Hi

I have the file cpop.ltx file (containg LaTeX) in my package which gets processed to produce a pdf file for the vignettes when the package gets installed. However, CRAN checks give

* checking sizes of PDF files under 'inst/doc' ... WARNING
  'gs+qpdf' made some significant size reductions:
     compacted 'cpop.pdf' from 805Kb to 547Kb
  consider running tools::compactPDF(gs_quality = "ebook") on these files

I do not understand how I can do this given that the pdf is produced when installing the package. Any ideas ?

I think that the PDF file is built during R CMD build, not (only) R CMD
INSTALL. At the very least, the source package currently on CRAN
contains both the *.pdf and the *.ltx files under inst/doc:
https://github.com/cran/cpop/tree/master/inst/doc

Does it help to pass the --compact-vignettes=gs+qpdf argument to R CMD
build? It seems to be off by default.

Hi Matthias,

Thank you very much for your response!

Putting the entire compiler toolchain of Rust into an R package is likely
just too much (it would need to compile the entire LLVM compiler which
would take hours just to build alone).
However, it is a very interesting idea to consider with dependencies.
(Having a separate optional package that contains the source code of all
Rust-dependencies necessary for the package) So thank you for sharing!

I was also made aware of this similar thread:
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-package-devel/2022q3/008291.html

Best,
Florian

I find command-line helper scripts convenient in my workflow, and so I added
dozens in the examples/ folder of the littler package. I had already relied
on 'build.r' to build the source packages and find this message tedious too
so about a year ago I changed it to default to compact at _source_ build
time. The script is (thanks to doctopt) all of about five lines of which the
final three are

  argv <- if (opt$fast) c("--no-build-vignettes", "--no-manual", opt$PACKAGES) else opt$PACKAGES

  extraargs <- c("--compact-vignettes=both", "--resave-data", argv)

  tools:::.build_packages(extraargs, no.q=interactive())

Does the trick for me (and CRAN as I get no nags on packages made this way).

Dirk

Florian,

this does not directly address your question, but I think it would make a lot of sense to standardize the process, given how many issues there were with packages using Rust (mainly not detecting compilers correctly, not supplying source code, unsolicited writing into user's directories, not checking binaries etc.). Doing this right is not entirely trivial which is presumably where the "friction" comes from. I'm not a Rust user myself, but just based on the other languages that have interfaces from R I would think that Rust users could coalesce and write a package that does the heavy lifting and can be used by packages that contain Rust code as a foundation - that's what most other language interfaces do. (It's quite possible that some of the projects you listed would be a good start). I would not recommend putting that burden onto each package author as it screams maintenance nightmare.

Cheers,
Simon

All we need is the rustc/cargo toolchain to be installed on the CRAN
win/mac builders (it already is on Fedora/Debian). As mentioned above
(and before in e.g. https://jeroen.github.io/erum2018), rust uses the
native C FFI, does not need any runtime library, and can be called
directly from an R package using the C interface.  There is really no
need for frameworks or engines (like Rcpp/rJava/V8), this is precisely
what makes Rust so nice as an embedded language, and why it is being
adopted in many C projects such the Linux kernel, that would never
want to deal with Java/C++/JS.

I understand the sentiment but Rust is very different from e.g. Java.
There really isn't much "heavy lifting" to do, because there are no
complex type conversions or runtime library involved. If the same
structs are used in C and Rust, the C functions can directly call Rust
functions and vice versa. Therefore it is possible for libraries to
incrementally port pieces of C code to Rust without breaking the ABI.
Just have a look at the hello world examples such as:
https://github.com/r-rust/hellorust or for a real world example:
https://cran.r-project.org/package=gifski

Seconded. CRAN works best when tools are uniformly provided. It would be good
to have that for Rust too.

(Small nit about C++ here. Its compatibility with C and use of FFI via C is a
major reason for its success. As you know there is no run-time so equating

Again, ditto for C++ but Rust is another very compelling candidate that would
be good to support (and to e.g. access projects like polars more easily).

CRAN is often seen as having somewhat difficult-to-overcome resistance for
outside help (with Rtools4 a very notable and successful exception).

Maybe enabling Rust support could be a pilot-project for another approach?

Jeroen,

sorry, I think you misunderstood: CRAN machines have the compilers, but the packages were not detecting it properly and/or were violating the CRAN policies as noted, so that's why I was saying that it would make sense to have a unified approach so that each package author doesn't have to make the same mistakes over again.

Cheers,
Simon

Would you be able to provide a sample package, say, "hello.rust", that does
that to guide us all?

No, because I don't use Rust. That's why I was saying that the Rust users should get together and create a such package. Some of the packages listed have experience in fixing the problems, so I would hope they can provide guidance or a good starting point. This is something for the interested community to do.

Cheers,
Simon

Greetings,

I would like to follow up on this issue.
First of all, thank you to everyone who took the time to think about the issue.
As Mr. Dirk Eddelbuettel suggested,  I investigated other packages that perform numerical optimizations using RcppNumerical. The only difference I saw is that all those packages put

#define NDEBUG

after #include <RcppArmadillo.h>.
I did the same thing without understanding :). This solves the issue.


Best,
Aristide

This is the only way I know to compute integrals of perform numerical optimizations in Rcpp. The other way might be: construct the function to be minimized in Rcpp and use the function optim in R. But this is not efficient.

That package is also used by others [1] and you should maybe study their code
and setup as it seems unlikely to me that your woes are due to
RcppNumerical. It likely is a simple inadvertent issue in your package.

[1] https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/RcppNumerical/index.html shows
Reverse imports:
  BayesPPD, ccdf, glmdisc, MCPModPack, secr, teachingApps
Reverse linking to:
  apeglm, BayesPPD, BVSNLP, CDatanet, COMIX, fido, gbeta, glmdisc,
  MCPModPack, OwenQ, secr, teachingApps, vennLasso, ztpln
which should give you plenty of examples.

Glad you got it working! If you're curious why it helped, see
<https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/error/assert>.

I wouldn't have guessed this to be the problem, because I "knew" that R
CMD INSTALL defines NDEBUG during compilation in order to prevent
assert() from crashing the process. Indeed, it's easy to verify that
RcppArmadillo removes the NDEBUG preprocessor symbol:

https://github.com/RcppCore/RcppArmadillo/search?q=NDEBUG&type=code

Seeing the search results, I can't help but wonder whether Armadillo
still makes any decisions based on this preprocessor definition,
though. Is the whole of Armadillo included as part of the package?
Shouldn't there be other mentions of NDEBUG besides the "#undef NDEBUG"
and the package changelog?

I don't see NDEBUG mentioned in the Armadillo source repo, either:
https://gitlab.com/search?search=NDEBUG&nav_source=navbar&project_id=6604173&search_code=true&repository_ref=11.4.x

Could the #undef NDEBUG line be safely removed now without affecting
the debugging tests performed by Armadillo?

Ivan,

Thanks for following-up but I think this issue is local to the OP as R is
already setup exactly that way to skip `assert()` in builds (in perfect
congruence with the CRAN Repository Policy)

  edd at rob:~$ grep NDEBUG /etc/R/Makeconf 
  R_XTRA_CPPFLAGS =  -I"$(R_INCLUDE_DIR)" -DNDEBUG
  ALL_CPPFLAGS =  -I"$(R_INCLUDE_DIR)" -DNDEBUG $(PKG_CPPFLAGS) $(CLINK_CPPFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) 
  edd at rob:~$ 

Armadillo (upstream) is very widely used, RcppArmadillo is now used by over
1000 packages and had (by partial counts from the subset of CRAN mirrors
offering logs) over 25 million downloads. I would be rather surprised if
there were a systemic issue we have not seen. So per Occam's Razor, I would
look under a different street light.

Best, Dirk

Hello,

I was convinced that the issue is local. The warning message only appears
on MAC.
I did not try with another computer. I used CRAN macbuilder service and got
the warning message. I guess this is also the computer CRAN uses.
