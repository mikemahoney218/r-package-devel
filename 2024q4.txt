A third solution would be to create a `esa.plot` method that redirects 
the user to `esaPlot` etc. So you create a function `esa.plot`. Its 
arguments should match those of the `esa` generic. If the `esaPlot` 
function has completely different arguments, you could have this 
`esa.plot` function give an error, redirecting the user to `esaPlot`.

You will still need to document the `esa.plot` function as a method to 
prevent warnings/notes:

\usage{
\method{esa}{plot}(..)
}

And you should export it:

export(esa.plot)

So that it can be called directly. To prevent that the `esa.plot` is 
called when a user passes a `plot` object to the `esa` generic, you 
could use the solution mentioned below:

In NAMESPACE you can do:

S3method(esa, plot, esaplotmethod)

To register `esaplotmethod` as the method that is called when using 
`esa` with an object of type `plot`. This would prevent this issue. 
However, this probably (can't test as the note doesn't happen on my 
system) doesn't resolve the issue with the NOTE.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Question about Debian installation error
Message-ID: <617BD822-1EE1-4928-AA9F-42CDFB069B84@gmail.com>

Hi R-package-devel team, 

  I have a question about installation error on Debian. 

  I recently updated my package ?glmtlp? to meet the ?_PACKAGE? requirement and to deal with the ?noRemap" requirement. I only modified the DESCRIPTION and glmtlp-package.R file and fixed a few typos. R CMD check showed no errors in my local machine (MacOS), but when I submitted to CRAN, it said installation error on Debian. 

  The log file is at: https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/glmtlp_2.0.2_20240930_002619/Debian/00install.out. 

  I also used devtools::use_github_action() to check and found the installation error occurred in ubuntu-latest (devel) but not the others, as shown below.
 ?

  My guess was that the Makevars file was not correctly written. I am not an expert in this and I tried different options, but none of them worked. Do you have any suggestions in handling this?

  Thank you so much for your time and help!

Best,
Yu

Thank you for providing the link to the failing example. The
screenshot(?) didn't come through [1]; this mailing list only accepts
plain text messages and a restricted set of attachment types, so it's
best to compose in plain text as well.

The reason your package is failing is because your C++ code calls R API
functions by their short ("remapped") names, and this will no longer
work in the next version of R. This has been mentioned in the news for
R-devel [2,3]. The remapping is described in "Writing R Extensions",
chapter 6 [4] (and a bit more at the end, shortly before chapter 7).

In short, to reproduce the error outside of R-devel, you need to
#define R_NO_REMAP before #including R API (or provide the -DR_NO_REMAP
command-line switch to the compiler), and then fix it by finding every
remapped name in your code and replacing it by the full name (typically
by prepending Rf_ to it).

You're not the first package author to have problems with C++ code due
to R_NO_REMAP [5]. There's now an incomplete, unofficial set of
manpage-style API documentation (made possible by Luke Tierney's effort
to export a list of API functions programmatically via tools:::funAPI)
where you can find both full and remapped names for most of "ordinary"
R API and slightly less than a half of experimental R API [6]. Thanks
to Erez Shomron, there's also information about when a lot of the
functions had been introduced.

The reason we have remapping in the first place is that for historical
reasons, R API contained a lot of functions with "ordinary" names, such
as "length", which conflicted with other C functions named "length" in
the same namespace. This problem has been solved at the cost of
introducing a more manageable problem by remapping: the "real" names of
the conflicting functions now start with Rf_ (e.g. "Rf_length"), and to
avoid breaking all existing code (including R itself), R uses the C
preprocessor to replace the short names with the full names on the fly:
"#define length Rf_length" and so on.

Unfortunately, that still leads to conflicts when you need to use
something named "length" (e.g. [7]) in a source file that #includes the
R API. You type s.length(), and the preprocessor patches that to
s.Rf_length(), and everything breaks. Since C++ code is the most
affected by this, the R developers are now disabling it for all C++
code.

Hope this helps!

Excellent idea, thank you! It does work for R CMD check as well:

Sys.setenv("_R_CHECK_S3_METHODS_SHOW_POSSIBLE_ISSUES_" = 'TRUE')
tools::checkS3methods(dir = '.') # used to show esa.plot as well
# Apparent methods for exported generics not registered:
#   fxi.contour fxi.mode

No need for extra bits or attributes on the esa.plot function, just
register a method for "esa" generic, "plot" class to prevent S3
dispatch from reaching the function in question.

Almost too good to be true: with this in my NAMESPACE

export (esa.plot)
S3method(esa,plot)

it seems I can deprecate esa.plot by the usual route (calling .Deprecated and passing call through to the new function esaPlot).

Thanks!
Murray

Hello,

I am hoping this is the correct way to pose a question about my submission, which I can?t seem to fix 2 NOTES for.  They are related to run time:
Flavor: r-devel-windows-x86_64
Check: examples, Result: NOTE
Examples with CPU (user + system) or elapsed time > 10s
           user system elapsed
countTree 17.66   0.13   17.78
estTree   17.52   0.02   17.54
wmmTree   15.70   0.02   15.72

Flavor: r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-gcc
Check: examples, Result: NOTE
Examples with CPU (user + system) or elapsed time > 5s
            user system elapsed
countTree 14.218  0.077  14.401
wmmTree   14.049  0.028  14.086
estTree   14.046  0.012  14.066

The package enables easy implementation of a sampling method for population size estimation on a highly correlated tree - since it?s sequentially sampled, it?s expected to run long compared to other functionality, even on smaller examples. 
I have added many layers to try to shorten examples and tests, including ?donttest?, ?dontrun?, ?if (interactive())?, and reducing toy examples to what I believe is the smallest they can be to still demonstrate utility.  I also included the ?skip_on_cran()? function in tests which run longer.

Does anyone else have any ideas on how I can eliminate these notes?

Any help is very much appreciated!!
Thank you!

Dear Mallory,

It would help a little bit if we know the package and we can check the
examples and code.
Perhaps it can help this little explanation of when to use donttest,
dontrun and other options:
https://contributor.r-project.org/cran-cookbook/general_issues.html#structuring-of-examples
If it is still too long I would leave the representative example for a
vignette or demo (or an article if you use pkgdown) and show how to use the
different parameters of your functions in the examples.

Best,

Wrap the abbreviations and software names into 'single quotes':
https://contributor.r-project.org/cran-cookbook/description_issues.html#formatting-software-names.
Some of the acronyms may need to be explained in the submission
comments in the CRAN web form.

I see you've tried to put the acronyms into the WORDLIST, but I think
the interface for spell-checking the package is different (see
?'aspell-utils') and involves saving vectors of words into .rds files
in .aspell and describing them in .aspell/defaults.R.

(If anything reads WORDLIST, why doesn't grep -r WORDLIST src on the R
source code show anything?)

Some code from your package that ran during R CMD check (it's usually
examples or tests) created the file named "redatam" in the temporary
directory and didn't remove it afterwards. I'm not seeing any R code do
this, so it must be something in the libredengine DLL. Can you make it
remove its temporary files during _redatam_redatam_destroy()?

There are more serious problems not flagged by R CMD check.

Your code downloads a binary DLL during the configuration stage. What
is the license under which it is shipped? Will it work on macOS? CRAN
policy recommends including sources or downloading (and compiling on
the fly) a fixed version rather than the latest one, although I know
of exceptions for some open-source libraries.

Almost all your examples are wrapped in \dontrun{}. Generally, this is
only allowed for code that absolutely has no chance of running as
written, for example, due to a missing API key:
https://contributor.r-project.org/cran-cookbook/general_issues.html#structuring-of-examples

Your NAMESPACE contains a lot of extraneous stuff. You intend for the
user to call functions redatam.open(), redatam.query(), and so on, but
roxygen2 misinterpreted those as S3 methods and registered them for the
S3 generic redatam, which doesn't do anything and isn't properly
documented. It's best to get rid of the S3 generic and only export the
functions by name (e.g. export(redatam.open, redatam.query)) instead of
resorting to exportPattern("^[[:alpha:]]+"). Maybe it's best to just
avoid dots in the function names altogether, lest something else
misinterprets them as S3 methods.

Your "Description:" field says "you need R (>=4.0)", which is better
expressed as a separate field, "Depends: R (>= 4.0)".

Hi Ivan,

Thanks for you reply, I appreciate your help.

Actually, with your help, I fixex the issues :


  *   I enclose between single quotes Redata, RXDB and DICX
  *   I fixed the version of binaries downloaded, for example redatamx-core-linux-20241010.zip
  *   The binary DLL/so library generate a LOG file in temp/redatam directory, so I remove the directory in .onUnload
  *   The \dontrun in examples. To run the examples, we need a database, the package doesn't include a sample database, so the code can't be run. I remove \dontrun in functions that can run without a database (for example redatam_version)
  *   All the exported functions, now have the name redatam_XXX (where XXX is open, close, etc.)

Regarding to the DLL downloading during the configurarion, REDATAM is not an open source software (the source code is controlled by CELADE-CEPAL), but the binary is freely  distributed, you can get a copy from https://redatam.org/es/aplicaciones (Redatam X version)

Thanks

That makes perfect sense. Can you provide a small example database as
part of the package? It's best to exercise as much of the code of
package as reasonably possible in tests and examples. If not, leaving
\dontrun{} in is indeed the right choice.

Thank you for clarifying that. It may help to follow the example of the
'Rblpapi' package <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rblpapi> in
specifying the license covering the package as a whole. In particular,
you need to ensure that CRAN has the right to redistribute Redatam DLLs
as part of the binary packages they compile. I'm not seeing a license
covering the downloads at https://redatam.org/es/aplicaciones or
https://redatam.org/en/software.

Good luck! For best results next time you have a question, please
provide a link to the latest version of the package source code.
