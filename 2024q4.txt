A third solution would be to create a `esa.plot` method that redirects 
the user to `esaPlot` etc. So you create a function `esa.plot`. Its 
arguments should match those of the `esa` generic. If the `esaPlot` 
function has completely different arguments, you could have this 
`esa.plot` function give an error, redirecting the user to `esaPlot`.

You will still need to document the `esa.plot` function as a method to 
prevent warnings/notes:

\usage{
\method{esa}{plot}(..)
}

And you should export it:

export(esa.plot)

So that it can be called directly. To prevent that the `esa.plot` is 
called when a user passes a `plot` object to the `esa` generic, you 
could use the solution mentioned below:

In NAMESPACE you can do:

S3method(esa, plot, esaplotmethod)

To register `esaplotmethod` as the method that is called when using 
`esa` with an object of type `plot`. This would prevent this issue. 
However, this probably (can't test as the note doesn't happen on my 
system) doesn't resolve the issue with the NOTE.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Question about Debian installation error
Message-ID: <617BD822-1EE1-4928-AA9F-42CDFB069B84@gmail.com>

Hi R-package-devel team, 

  I have a question about installation error on Debian. 

  I recently updated my package ?glmtlp? to meet the ?_PACKAGE? requirement and to deal with the ?noRemap" requirement. I only modified the DESCRIPTION and glmtlp-package.R file and fixed a few typos. R CMD check showed no errors in my local machine (MacOS), but when I submitted to CRAN, it said installation error on Debian. 

  The log file is at: https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/glmtlp_2.0.2_20240930_002619/Debian/00install.out. 

  I also used devtools::use_github_action() to check and found the installation error occurred in ubuntu-latest (devel) but not the others, as shown below.
 ?

  My guess was that the Makevars file was not correctly written. I am not an expert in this and I tried different options, but none of them worked. Do you have any suggestions in handling this?

  Thank you so much for your time and help!

Best,
Yu

Thank you for providing the link to the failing example. The
screenshot(?) didn't come through [1]; this mailing list only accepts
plain text messages and a restricted set of attachment types, so it's
best to compose in plain text as well.

The reason your package is failing is because your C++ code calls R API
functions by their short ("remapped") names, and this will no longer
work in the next version of R. This has been mentioned in the news for
R-devel [2,3]. The remapping is described in "Writing R Extensions",
chapter 6 [4] (and a bit more at the end, shortly before chapter 7).

In short, to reproduce the error outside of R-devel, you need to
#define R_NO_REMAP before #including R API (or provide the -DR_NO_REMAP
command-line switch to the compiler), and then fix it by finding every
remapped name in your code and replacing it by the full name (typically
by prepending Rf_ to it).

You're not the first package author to have problems with C++ code due
to R_NO_REMAP [5]. There's now an incomplete, unofficial set of
manpage-style API documentation (made possible by Luke Tierney's effort
to export a list of API functions programmatically via tools:::funAPI)
where you can find both full and remapped names for most of "ordinary"
R API and slightly less than a half of experimental R API [6]. Thanks
to Erez Shomron, there's also information about when a lot of the
functions had been introduced.

The reason we have remapping in the first place is that for historical
reasons, R API contained a lot of functions with "ordinary" names, such
as "length", which conflicted with other C functions named "length" in
the same namespace. This problem has been solved at the cost of
introducing a more manageable problem by remapping: the "real" names of
the conflicting functions now start with Rf_ (e.g. "Rf_length"), and to
avoid breaking all existing code (including R itself), R uses the C
preprocessor to replace the short names with the full names on the fly:
"#define length Rf_length" and so on.

Unfortunately, that still leads to conflicts when you need to use
something named "length" (e.g. [7]) in a source file that #includes the
R API. You type s.length(), and the preprocessor patches that to
s.Rf_length(), and everything breaks. Since C++ code is the most
affected by this, the R developers are now disabling it for all C++
code.

Hope this helps!

Excellent idea, thank you! It does work for R CMD check as well:

Sys.setenv("_R_CHECK_S3_METHODS_SHOW_POSSIBLE_ISSUES_" = 'TRUE')
tools::checkS3methods(dir = '.') # used to show esa.plot as well
# Apparent methods for exported generics not registered:
#   fxi.contour fxi.mode

No need for extra bits or attributes on the esa.plot function, just
register a method for "esa" generic, "plot" class to prevent S3
dispatch from reaching the function in question.

Almost too good to be true: with this in my NAMESPACE

export (esa.plot)
S3method(esa,plot)

it seems I can deprecate esa.plot by the usual route (calling .Deprecated and passing call through to the new function esaPlot).

Thanks!
Murray

Hello,

I am hoping this is the correct way to pose a question about my submission, which I can?t seem to fix 2 NOTES for.  They are related to run time:
Flavor: r-devel-windows-x86_64
Check: examples, Result: NOTE
Examples with CPU (user + system) or elapsed time > 10s
           user system elapsed
countTree 17.66   0.13   17.78
estTree   17.52   0.02   17.54
wmmTree   15.70   0.02   15.72

Flavor: r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-gcc
Check: examples, Result: NOTE
Examples with CPU (user + system) or elapsed time > 5s
            user system elapsed
countTree 14.218  0.077  14.401
wmmTree   14.049  0.028  14.086
estTree   14.046  0.012  14.066

The package enables easy implementation of a sampling method for population size estimation on a highly correlated tree - since it?s sequentially sampled, it?s expected to run long compared to other functionality, even on smaller examples. 
I have added many layers to try to shorten examples and tests, including ?donttest?, ?dontrun?, ?if (interactive())?, and reducing toy examples to what I believe is the smallest they can be to still demonstrate utility.  I also included the ?skip_on_cran()? function in tests which run longer.

Does anyone else have any ideas on how I can eliminate these notes?

Any help is very much appreciated!!
Thank you!

Dear Mallory,

It would help a little bit if we know the package and we can check the
examples and code.
Perhaps it can help this little explanation of when to use donttest,
dontrun and other options:
https://contributor.r-project.org/cran-cookbook/general_issues.html#structuring-of-examples
If it is still too long I would leave the representative example for a
vignette or demo (or an article if you use pkgdown) and show how to use the
different parameters of your functions in the examples.

Best,

Wrap the abbreviations and software names into 'single quotes':
https://contributor.r-project.org/cran-cookbook/description_issues.html#formatting-software-names.
Some of the acronyms may need to be explained in the submission
comments in the CRAN web form.

I see you've tried to put the acronyms into the WORDLIST, but I think
the interface for spell-checking the package is different (see
?'aspell-utils') and involves saving vectors of words into .rds files
in .aspell and describing them in .aspell/defaults.R.

(If anything reads WORDLIST, why doesn't grep -r WORDLIST src on the R
source code show anything?)

Some code from your package that ran during R CMD check (it's usually
examples or tests) created the file named "redatam" in the temporary
directory and didn't remove it afterwards. I'm not seeing any R code do
this, so it must be something in the libredengine DLL. Can you make it
remove its temporary files during _redatam_redatam_destroy()?

There are more serious problems not flagged by R CMD check.

Your code downloads a binary DLL during the configuration stage. What
is the license under which it is shipped? Will it work on macOS? CRAN
policy recommends including sources or downloading (and compiling on
the fly) a fixed version rather than the latest one, although I know
of exceptions for some open-source libraries.

Almost all your examples are wrapped in \dontrun{}. Generally, this is
only allowed for code that absolutely has no chance of running as
written, for example, due to a missing API key:
https://contributor.r-project.org/cran-cookbook/general_issues.html#structuring-of-examples

Your NAMESPACE contains a lot of extraneous stuff. You intend for the
user to call functions redatam.open(), redatam.query(), and so on, but
roxygen2 misinterpreted those as S3 methods and registered them for the
S3 generic redatam, which doesn't do anything and isn't properly
documented. It's best to get rid of the S3 generic and only export the
functions by name (e.g. export(redatam.open, redatam.query)) instead of
resorting to exportPattern("^[[:alpha:]]+"). Maybe it's best to just
avoid dots in the function names altogether, lest something else
misinterprets them as S3 methods.

Your "Description:" field says "you need R (>=4.0)", which is better
expressed as a separate field, "Depends: R (>= 4.0)".

Hi Ivan,

Thanks for you reply, I appreciate your help.

Actually, with your help, I fixex the issues :


  *   I enclose between single quotes Redata, RXDB and DICX
  *   I fixed the version of binaries downloaded, for example redatamx-core-linux-20241010.zip
  *   The binary DLL/so library generate a LOG file in temp/redatam directory, so I remove the directory in .onUnload
  *   The \dontrun in examples. To run the examples, we need a database, the package doesn't include a sample database, so the code can't be run. I remove \dontrun in functions that can run without a database (for example redatam_version)
  *   All the exported functions, now have the name redatam_XXX (where XXX is open, close, etc.)

Regarding to the DLL downloading during the configurarion, REDATAM is not an open source software (the source code is controlled by CELADE-CEPAL), but the binary is freely  distributed, you can get a copy from https://redatam.org/es/aplicaciones (Redatam X version)

Thanks

That makes perfect sense. Can you provide a small example database as
part of the package? It's best to exercise as much of the code of
package as reasonably possible in tests and examples. If not, leaving
\dontrun{} in is indeed the right choice.

Thank you for clarifying that. It may help to follow the example of the
'Rblpapi' package <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rblpapi> in
specifying the license covering the package as a whole. In particular,
you need to ensure that CRAN has the right to redistribute Redatam DLLs
as part of the binary packages they compile. I'm not seeing a license
covering the downloads at https://redatam.org/es/aplicaciones or
https://redatam.org/en/software.

Good luck! For best results next time you have a question, please
provide a link to the latest version of the package source code.

Message-ID: <PAVPR03MB101039EE8E46028FAFFD96737D3452@PAVPR03MB10103.eurprd03.prod.outlook.com>

Hi all,
I have a new package that I submitted to CRAN, that uses rust (for reference, it's called rtiktoken and can be found here: https://github.com/DavZim/rtiktoken).
The submission failed as 1-2 NOTEs were found, most importantly: Installation took CPU time 7.2 times elapsed time.

In both my Makevars and Makevars.win files, I specify to use 2 cores for cargo build on CRAN machines (see below or here https://github.com/DavZim/rtiktoken/blob/master/src/Makevars#L21C2-L25C4) but I still get the NOTE. Furthermore, I only get this on Debian but not on Windows.

if [ -n "$_R_CHECK_LIMIT_CORES" ]; then \
? export BUILDFLAGS="-j 2 --offline"; \
else \
?export BUILDFLAGS="--offline"; \
fi
...
cargo build ${BUILDFLAGS} --lib --release --manifest-path=./rust/Cargo.toml --target-dir $(TARGET_DIR)

The check results are here

  *
Windows: https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/rtiktoken_0.0.3_20241016_135446/Windows/00check.log (1 NOTE about misspelled words and a URL not being available)
  *
Debian:https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/rtiktoken_0.0.3_20241016_135446/Debian/00check.log (2 NOTEs: installation time and misspelled words)

Now I am wondering if there is anything that I can do about this NOTE or if I should ignore it.
I did not find any reference to this in the "Using Rust in CRAN Packages" nor in other CRAN packages that use rust (eg gifski, string2path, arcpbf), but I might have missed something.

I found also the CARGO_BUILD_JOBS flag for rust (https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/environment-variables.html) but as I can't reproduce the error locally (or on other GitHub Actions runners), I don't want to trial-and-test-it on CRAN servers.

Thanks, any help is appreciated!
David

This environment variable is spelled with an extra underscore:
https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-ints.html#index-_005fR_005fCHECK_005fLIMIT_005fCORES_005f

At least one of Josiah's packages instead relies on the user setting
the NOT_CRAN environment variable:
https://github.com/extendr/b64/blob/67ff753f71676870e3b04657909050ae10ec2145/src/Makevars#L10-L28

"Not taking more than two parallel processes or threads during the CRAN
check" is a more general requirement for all packages, regardless of
whether they use Rust. A package that uses cmake -GNinja without
limiting the number of compiler processes or gives the -j$(nproc)
argument to a Make subprocess would have received this NOTE as well.

Thanks, Ivan! Yes, I would use the NOT_CRAN flag. But in the case of that
package, the CRAN_FLAGS are not set dynamically.
It would be a welcome PR to rextendr if anyone more comfortable with Make
would like to. The current
template Makevars is at
https://github.com/extendr/rextendr/blob/main/inst/templates/cran/Makevars.

David, it looks like you went about crafting your CRAN-compliance by
hand?hats off! If you want to be a little more
hands off in the future, you can check out the development version of
{rextendr} https://extendr.github.io/rextendr/dev/reference/cran.html
which provides Makevars and configure scripts that are CRAN compatible.

The general workflow for a new package would be something like:

usethis::create_package()
rextendr::use_extendr()
rextendr::use_cran_defaults()
rextendr::use_msrv("1.69") # or whatever MSRV you have
rextendr::vendor_pkgs()

If you, or anyone else for that matter, have additional questions, I
recommend joining the
extendr discord at https://discord.gg/Mt4Kauus.

For more "formal" questions a GitHub discussion or issue is also welcome
https://github.com/extendr/extendr/discussions

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Installation error when submitting package to CRAN
Message-ID: <da2d74d2d92ee1231f083ff304f25d97@cantab.net>



Apologies in advance for not providing a reproducible example, but I am 
unsure how to reproduce the below error, as it did not occur on my 
machine.

I recently submitted a package to CRAN, after which I received an 
automated email from ligges at statistik.tu-dortmund.de, saying my package 
had failed the automated checks. I was advised to ask for help on this 
mailing list if I did not know how to resolve the error.

Details of the automated checks are provided here: 
https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/hhmR_0.0.1_20241015_235116/

Essentially, when trying to install the package for Windows, the 
following error was produced.

```
* installing *source* package 'hhmR' ...
** using staged installation
** R
** data
*** moving datasets to lazyload DB
** inst
** byte-compile and prepare package for lazy loading
Error in loadNamespace(j <- i[[1L]], c(lib.loc, .libPaths()), 
versionCheck = vI[[j]]) :
   there is no package called 'farver'
Calls: <Anonymous> ... loadNamespace -> withRestarts -> withOneRestart 
-> doWithOneRestart
Execution halted
ERROR: lazy loading failed for package 'hhmR'
* removing 'd:/RCompile/CRANincoming/R-devel/lib/hhmR'
```

This error has never occurred before when testing the package using 
`devtools` or `rhub`. I imagine I probably need to add `library(farver)` 
somewhere in my package, but am unsure where.

If anyone has any advice about how to resolve this issue I would be very 
greatful.

Thank you in advance,

Michael

See the error - that looks like a temporary issue. I'd contact CRAN or resubmit.

You should not use "library(anything)" in a package. You should rely on the Imports: field in the DESCRIPTION file along with importFrom() in your NAMESPACE file, or the Suggests: field in the DESCRIPTION file and if (requireNamespace("anypackage"))  {anypackage::somefun} else {# avoid using anypackage}. See WRE 1.1.3.1.

But in this particular case this might be a temporary glitch on the CRAN server.

1. I looked, and farver is not declared in your DESCRIPTION file as any 
dependency. Is it used by another package you depend on?


2. We also see:

It's a transitive dependency via hhmR's Imports: patchwork, which in
turn Imports: farver.

Indeed, thank you, Ivan.
Then it was a temporary hicc up on the build server and should work for 
the resubmission of the fixed package.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] check_equal() test fails on ATLAS
Message-ID: <CAPhhD8mY0FNaQJmdag+TFz4uQ+yYOdNZMjgy5B9GXkRvp5+2ng@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

My package *WeightIt* is failing
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_WeightIt.html> the
CRAN test on ATLAS. The failure is due
<https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/Rblas/ATLAS/WeightIt.out> to a failed
*testthat* test comparing two covariance matrices using check_equal(). A
few things are confusing to me, so I'm not sure how to solve it.

First, the covariance matrices should be identical; there is no random
component in their computation and the the only difference in the calls
used to generate them are whether an argument is omitted or whether it is
explicitly set to its default (i.e., the purpose of the test is to ensure
the default argument corresponds to the supplied argument). I am willing to
accept that there is some non-deterministic process in ATLAS, e.g., where
convergence is measured based on time rather than number of iterations,
though I don't know if this is actually the case.

Second, the package tests have passed on previous CRAN checks (this is
weeks after this version was accepted to CRAN), on all other versions of R,
and in the rhub test
<https://github.com/ngreifer/WeightIt/actions/runs/11489721542/job/31979056981#step:6:124>
with ATLAS.

Does anyone have any advice on how to solve this? I know I can change the
tolerance argument to check_equal() but this is a case where the output
should be identical. I cannot reproduce the problem with rhub, so I can't
see where the problem is. Could this be a false alarm due to caching?
Thanks for any insights.

Noah

 *** caught segfault *** address (nil), cause 'unknown'
Message-ID: <CACSk52-bmXQzSBXwp+Q2jvK0ucw=_-XAt1iw3HVV=+-9PwGPRQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R packages developers,

I am the maintainer of the package spNetwork. It has been removed from CRAN
recently because of an issue with the new compiler clang19. The error came
from one of the dependencies: the package BH giving access to the boost c++
library (https://github.com/eddelbuettel/bh/issues/101).

The boost code has been updated since and I had no choice to include it
directly in my own package and remove the dependency to BH because its
maintainer does not plan a new release before december 2024.

However, there is a new error when I submit the package to CRAN (ubuntu
with clang19). The full report is here :
https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/spNetwork_0.4.4.4_20241026_034629/specialChecks/clang19/package/00install.out

The error occurred during the installation of the package, and the message
is not very helpful :

 *** caught segfault ***
address (nil), cause 'unknown'

It seems that the error is happening when loading a c++ module of my
package

Traceback:
 1: Module(module, mustStart = TRUE, where = env)
 2: doTryCatch(return(expr), name, parentenv, handler)
 3: tryCatchOne(expr, names, parentenv, handlers[[1L]])
 4: tryCatchList(expr, classes, parentenv, handlers)
 5: tryCatch(Module(module, mustStart = TRUE, where = env), error =
function(e) e)
 6: loadModule(module = "spatial_index_cpp", what = TRUE, env = ns,
 loadNow = TRUE)


It is rather strange because I have not edited this module since the last
version and the package is installing correctly on other platforms. I also
tried to validate it with rhub and it worked well even with ubuntu and
clang19 :
https://github.com/JeremyGelb/spNetwork/actions/runs/11527593888/job/32093568292

Does someone have an idea about what could be causing this error during the
installation ? Any help would be highly appreciated.

I have a specific branch in gihtub for this issue :
https://github.com/JeremyGelb/spNetwork/tree/refs/heads/CRAN-v4.

All the best

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] DESCRIPTION file corrections for accepted package
Message-ID: <CAMQoV_oo3ry2ZAsLDRMRASM9LE9ciOOy8a9W-Ykj9269gh=Bgg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R Package Developers,
I am seeking guidance regarding a situation with my package 'chisquare'
(version 1.1) on CRAN.

Current situation:

1. The package was submitted and (automatically) accepted to CRAN (version
1.1) after thorough local testing and complete devtools checks
(check_win_oldrelease(), check_win_release(), check_win_devel())

2. After acceptance, I received a request to make formatting changes to the
DESCRIPTION file by November 2, 2024:
-Remove version specifications for graphics and stats in Imports
-Update R version dependency format from R (>= 4.0.0) to R (>= 4.0)

3. Upon attempting to submit these formatting changes, I received a warning
about "Insufficient package version (submitted: 1.1, existing: 1.1)". I am
well aware that this warning typically indicates the need to increment the
version number for new submissions of existing packages, as per CRAN
policies.

This creates a procedural challenge:
-I need to make the requested DESCRIPTION file changes to retain the package
-The changes are purely formatting-related, not functional (all checks pass)
-I cannot submit without changing the version number
-However, incrementing the version number seems disproportionate for
formatting changes.

I would greatly appreciate guidance on the proper way to handle this
situation.
What is the recommended approach for submitting DESCRIPTION file formatting
corrections for an already-accepted package, given that incrementing the
version number might seem a bit disproportionate?

Thank you for your time and assistance.

The simplest thing is to just update the version.  Use 1.1.1 if you 
don't want to go to 1.2.

Dear Duncan,

Thank you for the straightforward guidance.

My initial query stemmed from a concern about versioning consistency - I
thought that once using three digits (1.1.1), I would need to maintain that
format (e.g., 1.2.0) in future updates. Your suggestion clarified that I
can use 1.1.1 for these formatting changes and still use 1.2 for future
substantial updates.

Best regards,

Gm

I don't think R will enforce a 3 part version just because you used it 
once.  You might have other reasons to try to maintain versioning 
consistency.

Perplexing. The method that usually works - starting a fresh Debian
trixie/sid virtual machine, installing clang-19 and R
build-dependencies, compiling R from source (with OR without
CXXFLAGS=-stdlib=libc++), installing fresh dependencies from CRAN
source packages and running R CMD check --as-cran - did not reproduce
the null pointer dereference and the crash.

The compiler versions did not exactly match (current Debian testing has
newer clang-19 than 19.1.0 that had compiled R or 19.1.1 that compiled
your package), but that looks very minor.

Although there was no crash on Windows, the Windows compilation log is
full of warnings about potential null pointer dereference:

https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/spNetwork_0.4.4.4_20241026_034629/Windows/00install.out

../inst/i/b/concept/detail/general.hpp:50:47: warning: 'this' pointer is null [-Wnonnull]
   50 |     static void failed() { ((Model*)0)->~Model(); }
      |                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~
../inst/i/b/concept/usage.hpp:20:5: note: in a call to non-static member function 'boost::concepts::usage_requirements<Model>::~usage_requirements() [with Model = boost::geometry::concepts::Box<boost::geometry::model::box<boost::geometry::model::point<double, 2, boost::geometry::cs::cartesian> > >]'
   20 |     ~usage_requirements() { ((Model*)0)->~Model(); }
      |     ^

I see that, for example,
boost::geometry::concepts::Box<boost::geometry::model::box>::dimension_checker::apply()
creates a null pointer boost::geometry::model::box * b = 0 and then
calls geometry::set<...>(*b, geometry::get<...>(*b)). This _could_ be a
red herring, but class boost::geometry::model::box has member
variables. Could a previous version of the clang-19 compiler have
failed to elide member variable access in this call for some reason?
(According to the standard, having a null `this` pointer is always
undefined behaviour, so the compiler would not be exactly wrong to make
the application crash if this code is ever reached.)

`R CMD check` uses the `package_version()` function to check that the
submitted package version is > the version on CRAN. You can use it to
check Duncan's hypothesis:

R$ # current update with 3-part version
R$ package_version("1.1.1") > package_version("1.1")
[1] TRUE
R$ # next update with only a 2-part version
R$ package_version("1.2") > package_version("1.1.1")
[1] TRUE

[1] FALSE

[1] TRUE

If you adopt the 2-digit versions but decide to keep the possibility for 3-letter ones for minor fixes (bugs; fixing CRAN NOTES, minor bugs etc.), always use the four-digit development versions, e.g. 1.1.0.9000 after release of 1.1, to keep the possibility for 1.2 or 1.1.1 for the following release.

That's one strategy, but it's not the one I use.  I generally increment 
the 3rd digit whenever I make a bug fix or minor change to the source. 
I won't necessarily release every one of those, but they'll be available 
on Github, and if I get a bug report that has been dealt with, I can say 
things like "that was fixed in version 1.2.12.  You can get 1.2.14 from 
Github using this code: ...., or wait a couple of months until a later 
version is released on CRAN".  I dislike Hadley's x.y.z.9000 scheme.

But it is not. ANY change requires a version bump. You cannot have two files with different content yet the same version - the whole point of version is to uniquely identify content. Whether the change is just cosmetic or not is irrelevant (in your case it is actually functional so not even a question). As Rob Gentleman is fond of saying, version numbers are cheap ;). In your case I?d just use 1.1-1 (see semantic versioning which is highly recommended to follow)

Simon

Message-ID: <CAAsVnmJ_j-Pf=b7Cq4q7UAMa9V1CLVuPsnnHUFORSoP66f5e4g@mail.gmail.com>

Dear friends,

I received clang-san error messages for all vignettes that include ggplot2
figures when submitting an R package to CRAN. Please see below for an
example.

How can I resolve this problem without replacing the ggplot2 figures with
base R plots?

Thank you in advance for your help.

Can you tell us more about/point us to the code for the plots that are
triggering these errors? (eg, are you using unusual fonts or other
settings?)

I found the link to the full test output at
<https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/trtswitch_0.1.1_20241030_031632/>
(it's best to link to the check logs and source code when seeking help
here) and I don't think these are caused by your code. fontconfig leaks
small amounts of memory by itself, without your package:

$ build-san/bin/R -q -s -e 'png("/dev/null"); plot(1,1); dev.off()'
null device
 1

I think that this check may need suppressions at least for fontconfig:
<https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerLeakSanitizer#suppressions>.
Alternatively, Prof. Kurt Hornik may set the environment variable
ASAN_OPTIONS="detect_leaks=0" like done by Prof. Brian D. Ripley:

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Warnings related to functions from the survival
 package
Message-ID: <CAAsVnmJ=EurBKD6ber9umE68bH5ZO6HhmHuhX4ryHbWgXJ+cqQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear friends,

I received the following warning messages related to functions from the
survival package. I didn't directly use the functions mentioned below:
coxph_wtest, agsurv5, survdiff2, and coxmart. I believe they are used by
higher-level functions from the survival package, such as survdiff and
coxph, which I used in my unit tests. Does anyone know how to get rid of
suchwarning to pass the CRAN checks?

Thank you very much in advance for your help.

Regards,
Kaifeng

This is something R does to call all .C() / .Fortran() functions. For
example, coxph_wtest actually takes int*, int*, double*, double*,
double*, double *, but R assumes that the calling convention is the
same as if it took 6 times void* and calls it through a pointer of a
different type [1]. In practice it works well, but formally, calling a
function through a pointer of a different type is undefined behaviour.
Unfortunately, there is no easy way to call arbitrary functions, like
.C() and .Fortran() do, without either breaking some rules (which
happens here) or generating function calls at runtime (like some
foreign function interfaces do, which is less portable).

This check may need suppressions for src/main/dotcode.c or special
attributes [2] on R's do_dotCode.

Yes, yes. This is in base R and can be ignored by package authors.

We might consider outsourcing this e.g. to libffi at some point, but for 
now, if you know an elegant, minimal way how to suppress this, and have 
the time and energy, a patch would be welcome. We've known about this 
since the start of this year, but it hasn't gotten high enough on 
anyone's priority list, and then popped up here.

Tomas

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] HTML validation error in roxygen2 generated
 documentation
Message-ID: <084d69e2-dc9e-41ba-aab9-21c0a5ef054f@Spark>

Dear list,

I'm trying to submit an updated version of R package scoringutils to CRAN (https://github.com/epiforecasts/scoringutils). I built the package using `R CMD build` with Roxygen2 7.3.2 both on Mac and on Ubuntu.

I'm seeing a NOTE related to several HTML validation problems (see below).

These are some of the offending Rd files and corresponding source files:

? https://github.com/epiforecasts/scoringutils/blob/main/man/ae_median_quantile.Rd, https://github.com/epiforecasts/scoringutils/blob/efb41afd9925ffc4b62963abc0642cc1f7447c22/R/metrics-quantile.R#L559
? https://github.com/epiforecasts/scoringutils/blob/main/man/dss_sample.Rd, https://github.com/epiforecasts/scoringutils/blob/efb41afd9925ffc4b62963abc0642cc1f7447c22/R/metrics-sample.R#L224
? https://github.com/epiforecasts/scoringutils/blob/main/man/interpolate_median.Rd, https://github.com/epiforecasts/scoringutils/blob/efb41afd9925ffc4b62963abc0642cc1f7447c22/R/metrics-quantile.R#L530


I suspect the issue might be related to images that get added using the following code (https://github.com/epiforecasts/scoringutils/blob/efb41afd9925ffc4b62963abc0642cc1f7447c22/R/documentation-templates.R#L106):

```
#' Illustration of required inputs for sample-based forecasts
#' @details # Input format
#' \if{html}{
#'? ?\out{<div style="text-align: left">}
#'? ?\figure{metrics-sample.png}{options: style="width:750px;max-width:100\%;"}
#'? ?\out{</div>}
#' }
#' \if{latex}{
#'? ?\figure{metrics-sample.png}
#' }
#' @name illustration-input-metric-sample
#' @keywords internal
NULL
```

I've tried changing @details to @section, tried adding linebreaks, but that didn't help, unfortunately.
Any help would be much appreciated, thank you!

Best wishes,
Nikos

Thank you for providing the links to the source code!

This can be diagnosed using R CMD Rdconv:

R CMD Rdconv -o ae_median_quantile.html -t html ae_median_quantile.Rd
tidy ae_median_quantile.html >/dev/null

Here are the lines around the problematic part of the HTML document:

-----------------------------------8<-----------------------------------
<h3>Input format</h3>


<div style="text-align: left">
<p><img src="../help/figures/metrics-quantile.png"
style="width:750px;max-width:100%;" alt="metrics-quantile.png" /> </div>


</p> <!-- here: inserting implicit <p>, trimming empty <p> -->
-----------------------------------8<-----------------------------------

This </p> is inserted here by Rd2HTML to terminate the paragraph
started above (I think by \figure if not by \section). Rd2HTML doesn't
know that you started and ended a <div> before this line, which
implicitly ended the previous <p>, which makes the present </p> an
error.

The only way I was able to silence the warning while preserving the
existing tag structure was to make it \out{</div><p>} to start the new
paragraph and provide some text for the auto-inserted </p> to finish
it. Maybe you'll come up with a better fix that doesn't rely on Rd2HTML
auto-inserting the terminating </p>. I'm not sure, but could it help to
set style="text-align: left;..." on \figure itself, without the <div>?

A fresh R-4.4.2 build compiled with clang-19 -fsanitize=function gives
the error:

$ bin/R -q -s -e 'library(survival); survdiff(Surv(futime, fustat) ~ rx,data=ovarian)'

SUMMARY: UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer: undefined-behavior dotcode.c:2008:2 

A suppression file will avoid the error without patching R:

$ cat dotcode.supp 
function:dotcode.c

or more fine-grained:

$ cat dotcode.supp
function:do_dotCode

$ UBSAN_OPTIONS="suppressions=$(realpath dotcode.supp)" bin/R -q -s -e 'library(survival); survdiff(Surv(futime, fustat) ~ rx,data=ovarian)'
Call:
survdiff(formula = Surv(futime, fustat) ~ rx, data = ovarian)
<and so on>

Alternatively, the following patch will also suppress the error:

Hi Ivan,

Thanks SO much for your quick help. Removing the <div> did not work. However, I now did

```
#' \if{html}{
#'? ?\out{<div style="text-align: left">}
#'? ?\figure{metrics-binary-point.png}{options: style="width:750px;max-width:100\%;"}
#'? ?\out{</div><p>}
#'? ?Overview of required input format for binary and point forecasts
#' }
```

with an addition <p> and some text, following your suggestion. And that worked like a charm. Also thank your for showing me R CMD Rdconv.

You made my day!
With gratitude and best regards,
Nikos

Thanks, yes - and there is also attribute_no_sanitizer_instrumentation 
in Defn.h - but isn't there a finer-grained way to suppress reports just 
of this particular issue, ideally at finer granularity than a function?

The line saying "function:do_dotCode" in the suppression file will
suppress errors just for mismatched function pointer types inside
do_dotCode(), because "function" is the name of this check [1]. Here's
do_dotCode with a different error added:

bin/R -q -s -e 'library(survival); survdiff(Surv(futime, fustat) ~
rx,data=ovarian)'

dotcode.c:1958:9: runtime error: 1e+100 is outside the range of

I don't think UBSan can suppress errors in a more precise manner. The
documentation only mentions files, functions ans libraries. Best I
could find was a 2020 comment [2] suggesting to separate the offending
code into a function and let the optimiser inline it.

Dear R-devs,

I?ve just submitted a bug-fix release of my package, pliman, to address
some reported errors. However, the new version, pliman_3.0.0.tar.gz, did
not pass the incoming checks automatically.

When testing locally using devtools::check() encountered no errors,
warnings, or notes. However, one error was flagged in the "Additional
issues checked" section, as seen here:
https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/noSuggests/pliman.out. This error has
already been addressed in the latest submission by including a check_ebi()
function to verify whether EBImage (from Bioconductor) is available before
running code that depends on it.

Today, I noticed that several stable packages, such as Rcpp and sf, were
unavailable during the check process for this submission. This wasn?t an
issue in the previously published version of pliman. Could this be a
temporary problem with the package availability on CRAN?

Here is the link to the checks for the new version of pliman. Any insights
or suggestions you might have would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Olivoto

I could be. (Auto-)build systems for 21k packages and 3 architectures can be
fragile, and we are in time of transition (R 4.4.2 just came about) so this
could have been spurious.  If in doubt, check the status of a given package
at its CRAN page. But I looked at the log links yu provided, and I saw no

I do not see your aforementioned 'check_ebi()' function at work. The
suggested package is not present, you are asked to not fail and just skip
but do not seem to do so. I think you need to fix that, and that the CRAN
messaging is fairly clear and standard here. I may of course have missed
something in which case 'my bad'.

A lot of packages are erring on CRAN at the moment. From time to time weird things happen en masse. It is better to wait a little for intermittent problems to clear themselves out, especially during the weekend.

Dear all,
Thanks for your prompt reply.

Dear Dirk, check_ebi() was added in the new version at the location I
believe might be triggering the error:

https://github.com/NEPEM-UFSC/pliman/blob/24a1781073f9b1a3141002f0985b0542b1f7178d/R/utils_imagem.R#L317

check_ebi <- function(){
  if(!requireNamespace("EBImage", quietly = TRUE)) {
    if(interactive() == TRUE){
      inst <-
        switch(menu(c("Yes", "No"), title = "Package {EBImage} required but
not installed.\nDo you want to install it now?"),
               "yes", "no")
      if(inst == "yes"){
        if(!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
          install.packages("BiocManager", quiet = TRUE)
        }
        BiocManager::install("EBImage",
                             update = FALSE,
                             ask = FALSE,
                             quiet = TRUE)
      } else{
        message("To use {pliman}, first install {EBImage} following the
directions at 'https://bioconductor.org/packages/EBImage'")
      }
    }
  }
}

Looking just now to the function, I realized that it will only work in an
interactive section. I'm not sure if it could be the source of the error
during the checks, because the latest stable version of pliman already
contained it and worked with no erros (but this could be related to the new
version of R or something indirectly related to it).

Anyway, I would appreciate any suggestions to make check_ebi() more robust,
mainly regarding on the way it is handled in the automatic CRAN checks.


Best regards,

Tiago,

Looking at https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/noSuggests/pliman.out
we see it errors after trying '* checking examples ...':

   * checking examples ... ERROR
   Running examples in ?pliman-Ex.R? failed
   The error most likely occurred in:
   
   > ### Name: as_image
   > ### Title: Create an 'Image' object
   > ### Aliases: as_image
   > 
   > ### ** Examples
   > 
   > img <-
   + as_image(rnorm(150 * 150 * 3),
   +          dim = c(150, 150, 3),
   +          colormode = 'Color')
   Error in loadNamespace(x) : there is no package called ?EBImage?
   Calls: as_image ... loadNamespace -> withRestarts -> withOneRestart -> doWithOneRestart
   Execution halted
   * checking PDF version of manual ... [12s/12s] OK

Looking at as_image.Rd in https://github.com/NEPEM-UFSC/pliman/blob/24a1781073f9b1a3141002f0985b0542b1f7178d/man/as_image.Rd
we see that you do have an \donttest{} there but that alone does not protect
you. Instead of

   \examples{
   \donttest{
   library(pliman)
   img <-
   as_image(rnorm(150 * 150 * 3),
            dim = c(150, 150, 3),
            colormode = 'Color')
   plot(img)
   }

I would do something like

  if (interactive() && requireNamespace("EBImage", quietly=TRUE)) {
    library(pliman)
    img <- as_image(rnorm(150 * 150 * 3), dim = c(150, 150, 3), colormode = 'Color')
    plot(img)
  }

where you could of course put that condition into a helper function.

Hope this helps,  Dirk

Dear Dirk,
Thank you so much for your tips.
I'll implement them and try a new submission.

Dear CRAN
I see a new NOTE, and I wonder if you would consider undoing this new
addition to checks? This would cause all of my packages to fail auto
checks, which would cause a lot of extra false positives, and lots of
extra work for both me and the CRAN team who works on approving
submissions which do not pass auto checks.
Thanks for your consideration

Was your package auto-rejected with this note?  Not all notes trigger a 
rejection, some (like the maintainer note just above) are just for 
information.

It looks to me that you are setting your version numbers in an
unorthodox manner, which could/will confuse the living Drambuie out of
people.

I conjecture that you are setting your version number to represent the
relevant date.  E.g. 2024.11.2  means 2 November, 2024 and 2024.1.24
means 24 January 2024.

In my understanding, the usual convention is for the version number to
be of the form l.m.n (or l.m-n) --- major.minor.patch (or
major.minor-patch).  The date should be specified in the *Date* field of
the DESCRIPTION file.

It probably does not matter a hell of a lot.  "Writing R Extensions"
just says that the version number should be "a sequence of at least two
(and usually three) non-negative integers separated by single ?.? or
?-? characters".

However you might save yourself some "NOTEs" by adhering to the
"l.m.n" convention and incrementing the components sequentially.

cheers,

Rolf Turner

Rolf,

The versioning method they?re using is referred to as CalVer
https://calver.org/ (not as catchy as SemVer) and it is actually quite
useful! With one look at the version you can get a good sense of it?s
general release date.

Posit, for example, moved their professional products to use this
versioning method a number of years ago.

I wouldn?t poopoo it so quickly!

CRAN does not object to these versioning, the notes are not the reason 
for rejection. Who told they are?

I thought that the auto-check robot only accepts submissions which
have Status: OK? (no NOTEs at all)
Is it documented somewhere which NOTEs are allowed by the auto-check service?

The auto checker will publish an R package that has Status: OK and no
Note_to_CRAN_maintainers.

The auto checker will reject an R package that has WARNINGs and/or ERRORS.

The auto checker will flag an R package for manual inspection otherwise. A
CRAN team member will see your NOTE and know it's nothing to worry about
and publish it anyway. I've had similar before, and I've waited at most 5
hours for someone to check and approve it.

This is much more difficult.

Most notes are actually also auo rejected, but not all, and that is a 
moving target, as we try to automate as much as possible.

Jumps in version numbers or results of spell check have a non neglible 
probability of false positives, hence get manually inspected once raised 
by the auto check system.

In this case the jump 1 --> 11 was flagged, because many people actually 
mean 1.1 instead, but it got manually confirmed and published.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Alternative to ifeq for Makevars
Message-ID: <CAL3ufUKNA5bqwMASsk6E0ZwtiU4LmMQc076q+fRiE9GC2+6uKg@mail.gmail.com>

I am working on refactoring some Makevars files and I am quite stuck. I
want to conditionally set the value of CRAN_FLAGS like so in my Makevars
files

ifeq ($(NOT_CRAN), false)
  CRAN_FLAGS = -j 2 --offline
else
  CRAN_FLAGS =
endif

Using ifeq appears to be the only way to get the value of CRAN_FLAGS to
persist within the $(STATILIB) portion of the Makevars file.

However, this results in a Warning

checking for GNU extensions in Makefiles ... WARNING
  Found the following file(s) containing GNU extensions:
    src/Makevars
  Portable Makefiles do not use GNU extensions such as +=, :=, $(shell),
  $(wildcard), ifeq ... endif, .NOTPARALLEL See section ?Writing portable
  packages? in the ?Writing R Extensions? manual.

How do other people address this?

Unless a better approach surfaces (detect the environment variable in
the configure script and generate src/Makevars from src/Makevars.in?),
you may be interested in the following movfuscator-like
POSIX-compatible trick: https://nullprogram.com/blog/2016/04/30/

EXTRA_FLAGS_true =
EXTRA_FLAGS_ = -j 2 --offline
EXTRA_FLAGS = $(EXTRA_FLAGS_$(NOT_CRAN))

(This one is untested, sorry.)

Thanks, Ivan!

Do you know of any good documentation on the use of Makevars.in with
configure?
The @VARNAME@ syntax is quite confusing and isn't explained in WRE from
what I can tell.

A configure script for an R package could be any POSIX-compatible shell
script, including a hand-written one that substitutes strings using sed
[*], or even one that delegates to R [**]. If you do want to use GNU
Autoconf, the relevant sections of the manual are 4.8 and 7.2:

Thanks, Ivan! I've been able to get quite far based on the code in
data.table*
which uses sed to generate the Makevars from the Makevars.in file. The new
challenge is that the Makevars file needs to be deleted after building.

The approach I have now is a cleanup script with only rm -rf src/Makevars.

This works *only* when --preclean or --clean is called. SO I'm not sure if
it is a
permanent solution. For example devtools::document() doesn't run the clean
step nor does pkgbuild::compile_dll().

I may keep banging my head against the keyboard on this...

I am pretty sure it does not need to be deleted. Just ignore it in the 
build (i.e. list it in .Rbuildignore, so it doesn't end up in the 
tarball, and each system installing the package recreates it).

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Why is Rf_Seql hidden?
Message-ID: <AS4P195MB14303DC7A2F4E9C48B00F194BE5D2@AS4P195MB1430.EURP195.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Hi everyone,

Checking if 2 strings are equal, when these strings might be of different encoding, whilst still maintaining good performance, can be quite difficult.
But R seems to manage reasonably well.
It appears that R uses Rf_seql() to check if 2 strings are equal.
But Rf_seql is not public in R's C API; it is hidden.
So I have 2 questions:

1) ?Why is Rf_Seql() hidden? (what would be the problem if it were made public?)
2) What would be an alternative way to re-create Rf_Seql (a way that is relatively stable)? (An example C function that re-creates Rf_seql() using R's public C Api would be really nice.)

Kind regards,


Tony.

It accepts two SEXP arguments but then performs operations on them that are only valid for CHARSXP objects. This might be unsafe.

How about R_compute_identical()? It tests for TYPEOF() equality and then quickly jumps to Seql() for CHARSXP values. It's listed among "experimental" APIs and so may grow more flags [*] in the future, but they don't seem relevant for CHARSXPs.

Probably the wrong place to look. :)  These messages have nothing to do
with writing extensions for R but with CRAN policies.  So more relevant
are:
	https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html
and
	https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/URL_checks.html
(latter linked from the former).

Not sure what the current state is, but IIRC in the past some websites
blocked requests for URLs during these checks as they thought a
crawler/robot was accessing their site.  As long as you are sure the
URL is accessible under normal circumstances by all (most?) users it
should be fine, you might just have to explain this in a note when
submitting your package.

Cheers,

	Berwin

These can be ignored: The websites report "Forbidden" state when the 
script asks for headers to verify the URLs are correct.
Not much you can do unless the websites are under your control.

Hi, Uwe, Kelly and Berwin:


	  Thanks for the replies.


	  Checking my "cran-comments.md" file after Berwin's reply, I found 
that I had documented two similar problems in 2022. One of these new 
problems was present in 2022 but not flagged then. The other is new. I 
documented them both in "cran-comments.md".


	  Thanks again,
	  Spencer Graves


p.s. If my memory worked better, I may not have needed to bother 
R-pkg-devel. (I don't think this memory problem is a symptom of dementia 
or senility, as I remember not remembering well decades ago ;-)

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Possible false negative for compiled C++ code in CRAN
 checks
Message-ID: <YT2PPFFFCD7005701B25728913116FEEC8BDD5E2@YT2PPFFFCD70057.CANPRD01.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Dear Developers,

I am writing to ask for insights on how to fix the errors in the Redatam package and get it  back to CRAN.

CRAN reported memory leaks for:

CLAN/ASAN: https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/memtests/clang-ASAN/redatam/00check.log
CLANG/UBSAN: https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/memtests/gcc-UBSAN/redatam/00check.log

The log reads:

"HINT: if you don't care about these errors you may set ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_container_overflow=0.
If you suspect a false positive see also: https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerContainerOverflow.
SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: container-overflow .../src/redatamlib/ByteArrayReader.cpp:170:23 in RedatamLib::ByteArrayReader::ReadByte()"

After asking on Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/q/79171799/3720258), it was suggested that I set 'CXXFLAGS="-stdlib=libc++"' in 'configure'. The question is very long and provides all the details that I skip here.

After googling and exploring different steps, I managed to run a Docker image that imitates CRAN's clang ASAN/UBSAN test, but adding 'CXXFLAGS' not only made the error persist, but also create a note about overwriting options.

According to a Microsoft thread, the problem is not the Redatam package's code, but the release of 'libc' that comes with the image (see https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/issues/5971). They suggest compiling 'libc' yourself instead of using the precompiled version. I would need to explore with a Fedora 36 image with Clang 19 with a compiled libc and explore if there is a difference.

I took a 'computer programming' class where I learned a bit of theory and how to write C++ using GCC and testing with 'valgrind' in the Ubuntu machines from the lab.

I am not an IT expert, and I honestly would like to fix this issue because I already have users emailing me because they use this package for "data archeology" and I use it for the same reason for my research in Political Science.

The alternative is to use old hardware and a point-and-click tool on Windows 98/XP, which is why I keep my old ThinkPad X200 and an external DVD reader. It not feasible to read old census data with modern hardware, which is a problem derived from it being in a closed source format. Even worse, some recent census data comes with an installer that does not work on Windows 10+, and that I was able to restore by using Wine on my main modern laptop.

Best wishes,

Dear Mauricio Vargas Sepulveda,

Welcome to R-package-devel!

These include container-overflow at
src/redatamlib/ByteArrayReader.cpp:170:23 and method calls with `this`
being a null pointer at src/redatamlib/FuzzyVariableParser.cpp:47 and
src/redatamlib/Entity.cpp:52.

A container-overflow in ByteArrayReader::ReadByte is dangerous because
the code is reading past the end of the vector populated with known
data. While the code doesn't crash, the remainder of the vector could
contain anything. This could invalidate the conclusions of a scientific
work if they end up being based on random contents of uninitialised
memory. You need to find out why m_currPos exceeds the number of bytes
in the array and prevent it from happening.

Calling methods on a null pointer is also an error in the code. This is
quite confusing, but I have a guess for what might be causing this:

  for (size_t i = 0; i < entities.size() - 1; ++i) {
    ret.push_back(
        {entities[i].GetBounds().second, entities[i + 1].GetBounds().first});
  }

If entities.size() is 0, entities.size() - 1 will overflow to a large
positive number, due to std::vector<T>::size_type being unsigned. The
loop will proceed accessing out-of-bounds elements of 'entities' until
something will cause it to crash. The guess could be completely wrong,
unfortunately.

Have you fixed these problems since v2.0.0?

I am not seeing alloc-dealloc-mismatch in the CRAN checks, neither in
the links you provided, nor in the latest pretest results at
<https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/redatam_2.0.3_20241107_154750/>.
I think that these indicate a problem with the way your GitHub actions
are set up. Have you received a CRAN check report with
alloc-dealloc-mismatch in it?

I've tried to compare the versions visible in the CRAN archive but
couldn't get far because there was a lot of formatting changes. What
exactly are the problems for which your latest submission of v2.0.3 has
been archived? Do you need help reproducing the container-overflow
and/or null object pointer errors?

Ivan

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Creating temporary files in tests/examples/vignettes
 - adhering to CRAN policies
Message-ID: <CWLP265MB20671BECDB67CB453264BA26B8582@CWLP265MB2067.GBRP265.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Hello,

The CRAN policies (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html) for R package development state:

"Packages should not write in the user's home filespace (including clipboards), nor anywhere else on the file system apart from the R session's temporary directory (or during installation in the location pointed to by TMPDIR: and such usage should be cleaned up)."

If a file is created in the R session's temporary directory, does it then need to be cleaned up? Or does it only apply "during installation in the location pointed to by TMPDIR". I am unsure, given the "and such usage should be cleaned up" is contained within the brackets, whether it applies to creating files in the temporary directory during function examples/vignettes/tests.

For example, the following command will create an SQLite database in the R session's temporary directory:

testdb <- RSQLite::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), tempfile("temp"))

Suppose a package function (called: myfunc) runs this command. Should the file created in the temporary directory have to be removed after running an example of myfunc, or a test for myfunc, or when myfunc is used in a vignette?

I think part of my confusion comes from not understanding what TMPDIR is during installation. Is this just the temporary directory used when vignettes are built during package installation? In which case they are effectively the same thing?

Many thanks

I think the idea is to do as below.  You can also make temporary directories in a similar way.

These include container-overflow at
src/redatamlib/ByteArrayReader.cpp:170:23 and method calls with `this`
being a null pointer at src/redatamlib/FuzzyVariableParser.cpp:47 and
src/redatamlib/Entity.cpp:52.

A container-overflow in ByteArrayReader::ReadByte is dangerous because
the code is reading past the end of the vector populated with known
data. While the code doesn't crash, the remainder of the vector could
contain anything. This could invalidate the conclusions of a scientific
work if they end up being based on random contents of uninitialised
memory. You need to find out why m_currPos exceeds the number of bytes
in the array and prevent it from happening.

Calling methods on a null pointer is also an error in the code. This is
quite confusing, but I have a guess for what might be causing this:

  for (size_t i = 0; i < entities.size() - 1; ++i) {
    ret.push_back(
        {entities[i].GetBounds().second, entities[i + 1].GetBounds().first});
  }

If entities.size() is 0, entities.size() - 1 will overflow to a large
positive number, due to std::vector<T>::size_type being unsigned. The
loop will proceed accessing out-of-bounds elements of 'entities' until
something will cause it to crash. The guess could be completely wrong,
unfortunately.

Have you fixed these problems since v2.0.0?

I am not seeing alloc-dealloc-mismatch in the CRAN checks, neither in
the links you provided, nor in the latest pretest results at
<https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/redatam_2.0.3_20241107_154750/>.
I think that these indicate a problem with the way your GitHub actions
are set up. Have you received a CRAN check report with
alloc-dealloc-mismatch in it?

I've tried to compare the versions visible in the CRAN archive but
couldn't get far because there was a lot of formatting changes. What
exactly are the problems for which your latest submission of v2.0.3 has
been archived? Do you need help reproducing the container-overflow
and/or null object pointer errors?

The issue persists, and I really appreciate the help. The last comment in Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79171799/addresssanitizer-error-alloc-dealloc-mismatch-operator-new-vs-free-in-r-packa?noredirect=1#comment139621299_79171799) suggests a false positive, and if that is the case, should I add that as a note when resubmitting?

For v2.0.3 I implemented a full refactor, where I simplified the code considerably while trying to solve what looks to be a false positive.

Now I implemented a "patch" based on the suggestion:

  vector<pair<size_t, size_t>> ret;

  // ADDED //
  if (entities.empty() || entities.size() == 0) {
    return ret;
  }
  ////////////

  for (size_t i = 0; i < entities.size() - 1; ++i) {
    ret.push_back(
        {entities[i].GetBounds().second, entities[i + 1].GetBounds().first});
  }

After testing with the R-Hub image "Clang Asan" with this code:

  # Define the package directory and Docker image
  PACKAGE_DIR=$(pwd)
  DOCKER_IMAGE="ghcr.io/r-hub/containers/clang-asan:latest"

  # Pull the Docker image
  docker pull $DOCKER_IMAGE

  # Run the R CMD check inside the Docker container
  docker run --rm -v "$PACKAGE_DIR":/workspace -w /workspace $DOCKER_IMAGE bash -c "
   Rscript -e 'if (!requireNamespace(\"pak\", quietly = TRUE)) { install.packages(\"pak\", repos = \"https://r-lib.github.io/p/pak/dev//") }'
   Rscript -e 'pak::pkg_install(\"decor\", dependencies = TRUE)'
   Rscript -e 'pak::pkg_install(\"rcmdcheck\", dependencies = TRUE)'
   Rscript -e 'pak::pkg_install(\"pkgbuild\", dependencies = TRUE)'
   Rscript -e 'pak::pkg_install(\".\", dependencies = TRUE)'
   Rscript -e 'pkgbuild::check_build_tools(debug = TRUE)'
   Rscript -e 'rcmdcheck::rcmdcheck(args = c(\"--no-manual\", \"--as-cran\"), build_args = \"--no-manual\", error_on = \"error\")'
  "

I get the following output:

Hello, All:


	  In running "R CMD check --as-cran Ecfun_0.3-5.tar.gz" on my local 
macOS 15.0.1 system, 00check.log contains "Found the following HTML 
validation problems:" followed by 501 lines like the following:

	  Lines like this seem to appear roughly for ~each(?) of the 59 *.Rd

which means that the number of lines like this is not the same for every 
*.Rd file.


	  Suggestions?
	  This looks like a problem with "R CMD check --as-cran" and NOT with 
Ecfun. However, I felt a need to ask.

When you run `tidy --version`, what does it say? If it doesn't say at

this is the wrong version of HTML-Tidy and you can safely discard the

I see the change on GitHub [1], made back on October 22nd, but I am not
seeing these checks in your latest submission to CRAN [2] from November
7th. Before you have implemented [1], have you been able to reproduce
the errors that your package received on CRAN, that is, the
container-overflow and the null object pointers?

I've just noticed that FuzzyVariableParser::ParseAllVariables is using
std::thread::hardware_concurrency(). CRAN uses a shared computer with
many cores to test many packages at the same time, so the code most
likely needs to limit itself to two threads during tests and examples
[3].

This is an error you're getting when testing with an R-hub image. R-hub
is not CRAN. You've performed good investigative work to reduce the
issue you're seeing on R-hub for the StackOverflow question [4], but it
looks like this particular problem is already reported to R-hub
developers [5] and it's not what got your latest CRAN submission
archived.

When your latest submission, redatam_2.0.3.tar.gz, was archived, you
should have received an e-mail from CRAN. Was it about the package
failing automatic checks? Were there any other comments? Did the e-mail
highlight any issues in particular?

I do see the problem in [6], but it's hard to diagnose by itself. I was
able to reproduce it (but only after compiling everything with
-shared-san and providing the necessary LD_LIBRARY_PATH, otherwise
packages using C++ failed to load; I also had to manually set
UBSAN_OPTIONS=print_stacktrace=1 to find out where the overflow
originates):

The corresponding lines of the source code are:

    : m_path(outputDirectory) {
  if ('/' != m_path.back()) { // <-- here
    m_path.append("/");
  }
}

Looks like the code is calling .back() on an empty string. This also
needs to be prevented somehow.

To summarise, I recommend to do the following for the next submission:

 - make sure the fix for the UBSan issues from [7] is included and note
   it in the submission comments
 - avoid using more than two threads during R CMD check
 - fix the empty string issue from [6] and note it in the submission
   comments
 - fix any other issues noted in the CRAN correspondence and note it in
   the submission comments
 - do not mention the alloc-free-mismatch problem in the submission
   comments

Good luck! I hope this helps and there won't be any more issues hiding
in the code.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] CRAN build error on Windows
Message-ID: <AS8PR10MB466318BEE8305A6903DBD580A7592@AS8PR10MB4663.EURPRD10.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Hi r-package-devel team,

I'm author of the ProTrackR2 package and have recently submitted a new release to CRAN. It builds without problems on all operating systems, except for Windows:

https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_ProTrackR2.html

At first I thought it might be a problem caused by my 'configure.win' script, which would be strange since it remained unchanged since the previously submitted version (which built without problems on Windows). Also, the package builds without problems on Windows machines at r-universe and the rhub checks. This is why I'm beginning to suspect that this is an issue with the CRAN Windows machine. The install.log from CRAN reports:

"Cannot create temporary file in D:\temp\2024_11_12_ 1_50_00_12637\: No such file or directory"

After snooping around I found another (unrelated) package with exactly the same problem:

https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_Amelia.html

This package has a completely different setup (no configure script, and it uses Rcpp instead of cpp11).

My question is: how can I figure out if something is wrong with my package setup, or whether this is an issue at CRAN with building for Windows?

Thanks in advance for your help!

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] New package with C++ code causes R abort in RStudio,
 not in R console.
Message-ID: <AM0PR09MB3843B5A6489B9D868B68F8C498592@AM0PR09MB3843.eurprd09.prod.outlook.com>

Dear R package developers,

I'm helping with the development of the lavaan package (see https://lavaan.ugent.be/) and currently writing a C++ version of the parser of the model syntax in lavaan. The package with C++ code is in  https://github.com/lucdw/lavaanC.?

When testing with a bunch of models, there is one model that causes an abort of the R session in RStudio (on Windows), but in the R console or in a batch job it causes no errors. The model is the following :?
model <- '?
?   F1 =~ "a b"*X1
? ? F2 =~ a * X1 + 3*X2 # dat is hier een beetje commentaar
? ? # efa block 2
? ? efa("efa2")*f3 +
? ? efa("efa2")*f4 =~ y1 + y2 + y3 + y1:y3
? ? f4 := 3.14159 * F2
? ? F1 ~ start(0.76)*F2 + a*F2
? ? a == (b + f3)^2
? ? b1 > exp(b2 + b3) '

and the translation can be tested - after installing lavaanC - with?

lavaanC::lav_parse_model_string_c(model)

As mentioned, this causes an abort of the R session when executed in RStudio on Windows (10 or 11), but passes without problem in the R console or a batch job. 

Because many users are using RStudio I 'd like to tackle this problem, but don't know how to pinpoint the cause of the problem. I hope some of you have an idea how to handle this problem ...

All the best,


Luc De Wilde

Dear Prof. Dr. Kryov,

Thanks a lot.

Apologies if the email has an odd format, I have a modified Outlook UI that makes everything "curious".

After taking each of the suggestions, now I get this with Clang-ASAN on R-Hub:

> 0 errors | 0 warnings | 2 note
> Package was archived on CRAN
> CRAN repository db overrides: X-CRAN-Comment: Archived on 2024-11-06 for repeated policy violation. Repeatedy spamming a team member's personal email address in HTML.
> checking compilation flags used ... NOTE Compilation used the following non-portable flag(s): ?-Wp,-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3?

This is great. Thanks a lot. I would like to add you to AUTHORS.md or as "ctb" to list your contribution. Hopefully it can be re-accepted.

The first note was because I was asking about this same issue when CRAN notified me. Now I make sure to use non-HTML email when sending R-related emails.

So far, this is the only useful communication I received about this. On Stack Overflow I only got "-1".

I added the changes here: https://github.com/pachadotdev/open-redatam/commit/d8955195d4e13fd7794de56d24b4238b7a7ec26f

Best wishes,

I see the change on GitHub [1], made back on October 22nd, but I am not
seeing these checks in your latest submission to CRAN [2] from November
7th. Before you have implemented [1], have you been able to reproduce
the errors that your package received on CRAN, that is, the
container-overflow and the null object pointers?

I've just noticed that FuzzyVariableParser::ParseAllVariables is using
std::thread::hardware_concurrency(). CRAN uses a shared computer with
many cores to test many packages at the same time, so the code most
likely needs to limit itself to two threads during tests and examples
[3].

This is an error you're getting when testing with an R-hub image. R-hub
is not CRAN. You've performed good investigative work to reduce the
issue you're seeing on R-hub for the StackOverflow question [4], but it
looks like this particular problem is already reported to R-hub
developers [5] and it's not what got your latest CRAN submission
archived.

When your latest submission, redatam_2.0.3.tar.gz, was archived, you
should have received an e-mail from CRAN. Was it about the package
failing automatic checks? Were there any other comments? Did the e-mail
highlight any issues in particular?

I do see the problem in [6], but it's hard to diagnose by itself. I was
able to reproduce it (but only after compiling everything with
-shared-san and providing the necessary LD_LIBRARY_PATH, otherwise
packages using C++ failed to load; I also had to manually set
UBSAN_OPTIONS=print_stacktrace=1 to find out where the overflow
originates):

Based on your quote and the log [1] it looks like you have a space in the
directory name. Windows can accommodate these but you must then quote them
prperly. A more defensive mechanism is to not have spaces there in the first
so may call `sub()` on the path replacing ' ' with '_'.

Hi Luc,

   The standard tools for writing parsers are "flex" and "bison" - they 
generate code automatically and so can save you a lot of effort. For 
language with simple syntax you can get away with just using "flex".

   Here are some examples:

Flex:

https://westes.github.io/flex/manual/Simple-Examples.html#Simple-Examples

Bison:

https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/manual/bison.html#Infix-Calc

3. "clang-asan: use clang 19 as CRAN does" (GitHub, https://github.com/r-hub/containers/pull/79#issuecomment-2470390769)

The package was tested with Clang 19 on Fedora 36 and Ubuntu 22, and as S.O. reads "it is likely a false positive in the container used by R-Hub as discussed in this [#598] issue at its repo but not a false positive but an actual error as shown in the setup at CRAN (different container)."

The R-Hub container was fixed with a pull request I sent, and now it passes the checks. The CRAN errors were addressed as mentioned in the mailing list.

I am also using "-Wall -O0 -pedantic" and "-UDEBUG -g" to check locally, and I am also using all the available R-Hub images (27 different configurations, as in https://github.com/pachadotdev/open-redatam/actions/runs/11801021816)

I would really appreciate some guidance here before re-submitting.

Best wishes,

Dear Prof. Dr. Kryov,

Thanks a lot.

Apologies if the email has an odd format, I have a modified Outlook UI that makes everything "curious".

After taking each of the suggestions, now I get this with Clang-ASAN on R-Hub:

> 0 errors | 0 warnings | 2 note
> Package was archived on CRAN
> CRAN repository db overrides: X-CRAN-Comment: Archived on 2024-11-06 for repeated policy violation. Repeatedy spamming a team member's personal email address in HTML.
> checking compilation flags used ... NOTE Compilation used the following non-portable flag(s): ??-Wp,-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3??

This is great. Thanks a lot. I would like to add you to AUTHORS.md or as "ctb" to list your contribution. Hopefully it can be re-accepted.

The first note was because I was asking about this same issue when CRAN notified me. Now I make sure to use non-HTML email when sending R-related emails.

So far, this is the only useful communication I received about this. On Stack Overflow I only got "-1".

I added the changes here: https://github.com/pachadotdev/open-redatam/commit/d8955195d4e13fd7794de56d24b4238b7a7ec26f

Best wishes,

I see the change on GitHub [1], made back on October 22nd, but I am not
seeing these checks in your latest submission to CRAN [2] from November
7th. Before you have implemented [1], have you been able to reproduce
the errors that your package received on CRAN, that is, the
container-overflow and the null object pointers?

I've just noticed that FuzzyVariableParser::ParseAllVariables is using
std::thread::hardware_concurrency(). CRAN uses a shared computer with
many cores to test many packages at the same time, so the code most
likely needs to limit itself to two threads during tests and examples
[3].

This is an error you're getting when testing with an R-hub image. R-hub
is not CRAN. You've performed good investigative work to reduce the
issue you're seeing on R-hub for the StackOverflow question [4], but it
looks like this particular problem is already reported to R-hub
developers [5] and it's not what got your latest CRAN submission
archived.

When your latest submission, redatam_2.0.3.tar.gz, was archived, you
should have received an e-mail from CRAN. Was it about the package
failing automatic checks? Were there any other comments? Did the e-mail
highlight any issues in particular?

I do see the problem in [6], but it's hard to diagnose by itself. I was
able to reproduce it (but only after compiling everything with
-shared-san and providing the necessary LD_LIBRARY_PATH, otherwise
packages using C++ failed to load; I also had to manually set
UBSAN_OPTIONS=print_stacktrace=1 to find out where the overflow
originates):

The corresponding lines of the source code are:

ListExporter::ListExporter(const std::string &outputDirectory)
    : m_path(outputDirectory) {
  if ('/' != m_path.back()) { // <-- here
    m_path.append("/");
  }
}

Looks like the code is calling .back() on an empty string. This also
needs to be prevented somehow.

To summarise, I recommend to do the following for the next submission:

 - make sure the fix for the UBSan issues from [7] is included and note
   it in the submission comments
 - avoid using more than two threads during R CMD check
 - fix the empty string issue from [6] and note it in the submission
   comments
 - fix any other issues noted in the CRAN correspondence and note it in
   the submission comments
 - do not mention the alloc-free-mismatch problem in the submission
   comments

Good luck! I hope this helps and there won't be any more issues hiding
in the code.

There's no actual alloc-free-mismatch, it's a false positive due to the

Dear Vladimir,

thank you for your reply.

The model syntax is not simple though and the parser needs to look at the meaning in SEM terms to accept or reject certain things.

Moreover, this is only a first step and later other calculations need to be done in C++, which is why I find it important to know exactly why the code works in R console but not in RStudio, and of course what can be done to make it work in RStudio also.

Kind regards,


Luc De Wilde

Hi Luc,

   The standard tools for writing parsers are "flex" and "bison" - they
generate code automatically and so can save you a lot of effort. For
language with simple syntax you can get away with just using "flex".

   Here are some examples:

Flex:

https://westes.github.io/flex/manual/Simple-Examples.html#Simple-Examples

Bison:

https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/manual/bison.html#Infix-Calc

This is a low-confidence guess, but there's a stray src/lavaanC.dll in
the repository. If you install the package straight from the source
directory, you may pick up the *.dll without recompiling it, which may
be incompatible with the version of R running inside RStudio.

If this does reproduce on a clean installation, the most informative
way forward would be to attach a debugger to the RStudio's R process
before it crashes.

That makes it more likely that this is a (hopefully transient) issue on the

I understand this doesn't feel like progress, but this time clang-san
is giving your package a clean bill of health. There are no issues to
fix here.

>   2.
> https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/redatam_2.0.3_20241112_165458/specialChecks/gcc-san/outputs.txt

This one, unfortunately, does demonstrate a new error in the package.
The problem with software testing is that it can only demonstrate the
presence of bugs, not their absence. The new error is different from
all the errors we've seen previously. The code at
redatamlib/readers/FuzzyVariableParser.cpp:33:38 performs an integer
division by zero, which crashes the process:

  size_t chunkSize = entities.size() / numThreads;

It's not in the outputs.txt, but in the summary.txt:
https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/redatam_2.0.3_20241112_165458/specialChecks/gcc-san/summary.txt

https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/thread/hardware_concurrency
says that std::thread::hardware_concurrency() could plausibly return 0.
Or is this due to empty entities vector?

Unfortunately, none of these use gcc with UBSanitizer enabled. I think
that the rocker/r-devel-san container [*] image comes closest to the
configuration that fails your package during the CRAN checks. By
running the following commands, I can reproduce the crash:

podman run -it docker.io/rocker/r-devel-san Rdevel
f <- 'https://cran.r-project.org/incoming/archive/redatam_2.0.3.tar.gz'
download.file(f, basename(f))
install.packages(c('data.table','janitor', 'stringi', 'knitr',
'rmarkdown','testthat'))
tools::Rcmd('check redatam_2.0.3.tar.gz')

By installing gdb inside the container, running Rdevel -d gdb and
setting a breakpoint on __ubsan_on_report, I can catch the moment
before the crash:

(gdb) frame 5
#5  0x00007f95bf293a16 in
RedatamLib::FuzzyVariableParser::ParseAllVariables
(this=this at entry=0x7fff80974bd0, entities=std::vector of length 0,
capacity 0) at redatamlib/readers/FuzzyVariableParser.cpp:33
33       size_t chunkSize = entities.size() / numThreads;
(gdb) p entities.size()
$1 = 0
(gdb) p numThreads
$2 = 0
(gdb) p maxThreads 
$3 = 4

The entities vector is empty, and the 0/0 integer division invokes
undefined behaviour.

Would you find it acceptable to also test your package using the
docker.io/rocker/r-devel-san container before the next submission?

Dear Ivan,

Thank you for your reply!
The error occurs on my local machine(s), where the dll is always reproduced by the "install package".
I have attached a debugger (from Visual Studio) to the R process, which gives me the message "A breakpoint instruction (__debugbreak() statement or similar call) was executed in rsession-utf8.exe.

When I go to the dll module in the Call Stack I get the message "Binary was not built with debug information". I do not know how to ask R CMD INSTALL to produce info which can be used by a debugger, perhaps you can direct me to the correct information to do so (in Windows)?

Luc

This is a low-confidence guess, but there's a stray src/lavaanC.dll in
the repository. If you install the package straight from the source
directory, you may pick up the *.dll without recompiling it, which may
be incompatible with the version of R running inside RStudio.

If this does reproduce on a clean installation, the most informative
way forward would be to attach a debugger to the RStudio's R process
before it crashes.

So the crash does happen inside lavaanC.dll, did I get this right?

If you set the environment variable DEBUG to a non-empty string before
compiling the package, the resulting *.dll will have debug information
in the DWARF format (this is set in file.path(R.home('etc'), 'x64',
'Makeconf')). Visual Studio might not work with it, so you could
install gdb into Rtools using pacman, or you could try to give the
executable to Dr. Mingw <https://github.com/jrfonseca/drmingw>.

What do you mean by "SEM terms" ? I have not seen a situation yet that a 
grammar could not be handled by bison, it does have mechanism to deal with 
exceptions to pure LR syntax.

My thought was that perhaps some sort of memory issues occurs because of 
the hand-written parser.

For example, one possibility is that stack sizes in R and Rstudio could be 
different. So if you are parsing something recursively it might work in 
one and not another.

The parsers generated by flex and bison are designed to handle arbitrary 
length inputs.

Thanks to your instructions I have found the probable reason of the crash: char* items allocated with "new char[...]" were deleted with 'delete' and not with 'delete[]' in one of the destructors. I will recheck my code and retry all tests.

For your information: Visual Studio debugger works with the debug info stored in the dll, it asks for the location of the source file (.cpp) and then shows the correct location of the problematic instruction.

Thanks a lot!

Luc

You are right, the temp dir got too big to handle and hence I have time 
specific temp dirs now. WHat I did not anticipate is that although 
Windows writes "01" for days, months, minutes, and seconds, it rather 
prints " 1" for hours when asking for %DATE% and %TIME% in a batch file.
Fixed in the meantime and check results should clear up soon.

Uwe

Dear Ivan,


Unfortunately the error did not go away, after the correction (delete[] where needed) still error free execution in R console but abort of the R process in Rstudio.

The debugger of RStudio did not give any useful information anymore. I then installed Drmingw and attached the R process of Rstudio to it.
When I then execute the tests everything happens error free ...
... until I close the debugger: then RStudio says that there is a fatal error in the R process and aborts it.

So of course I cannot find a cause this way!

Maybe you have an idea how to deal with this?



Luc

So the crash does happen inside lavaanC.dll, did I get this right?

If you set the environment variable DEBUG to a non-empty string before
compiling the package, the resulting *.dll will have debug information
in the DWARF format (this is set in file.path(R.home('etc'), 'x64',
'Makeconf')). Visual Studio might not work with it, so you could
install gdb into Rtools using pacman, or you could try to give the
executable to Dr. Mingw <https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjrfonseca%2Fdrmingw&data=05%7C02%7CLuc.DeWilde%40UGent.be%7C74c6b594e5414ac8486c08dd03619cae%7Cd7811cdeecef496c8f91a1786241b99c%7C1%7C0%7C638670439969607386%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=hiUfEIBkezT%2FoWd%2FC5ZJncKFkTNUZPmqiavOCLOzOUM%3D&reserved=0<https://github.com/jrfonseca/drmingw>>.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Closing a display window from a program
Message-ID: <d87c8648-0c41-406a-a4eb-88a08992b276@gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to prepare a package to manage some diverse data. It is
extremely convenient to display a PDF derived from the data so the user
can verify information that the R script is going to process (even nicer
if on a 2 monitor system). I've 2 issues:

1) I can display the pdf either with file_show() from the fs package
or browseURL(). Both leave the pdf displayed and return to the
R "terminal". But when I finish processing at the end of the script,
I want to have the display close. This seems to need (non-platform-neutral)
use of a system() call to wmctrl, which is only on X-windows systems.
Note that the display tools don't seem to return a handle that I can use to
close the display window some other way. On my system both the tools
for display loaded xreader (I'm on Linux Mint Wilma).

2) the tools also don't seem to offer window size or placement, which
   would be nice.

Suggestions welcome.

John Nash
