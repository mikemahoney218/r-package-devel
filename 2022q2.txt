Spencer, the suggestion are for chcks with R-4.2.0 alpha, for R-4.1.3 
the older toolchain is needed (but if no compiled code is used it may be 
fine to use the new one).

But then your qpdf is really in the Windows system32 directoy as 
suggested by
"C:\Windows\System32\qpdf_bin\qpdf.exe"
? I guess this is not the one from the new toolchain?


Best,
Uwe

Dear Spencer

If I understand correctly your package sos does not have compiled code 
so as someone suggested earlier you do not need Rtools at all. The only 
drawback is that when I check my packages I get a note that it cannot 
find qpdf but they all pass checks on CRAN (which obviously does have qpdf).

Message-ID: <8d05c5f1-1be0-f20e-45a3-747c015ffc2b@bristol.ac.uk>

I am having persistent but difficult-to-reproduce compilation errors for 
some CRAN tests on my package Nmix. These may be instances of the 
'parallel make' problem. A typical error message is
---
 ?? 30 |???????? use f2cio
 ????? |???????????????? 1
Fatal Error: Cannot open module file ?f2cio.mod? for reading at (1): No 
such file or directory
---

Apart from Nmix_init.c, my src directory has 8 source files:
---
.f : Nmix-sub3z, Nmix-aux, pnorm, rgamma, RNGfns
.c: wrapper.c
.f90: fef2cio, f2cio (each defining modules of the same name)
---

The dependency structure among them is summarised by:
---
Nmix-sub3z.f
 ?? ?calls pnorm.f rgamma.f Nmix-aux.f RNGfns.f
 ?? ?uses??? fef2cio.mod f2cio.mod
fef2cio.f90
 ?? ?uses? f2cio.mod
Nmix-aux.f
 ?? ?calls rgamma.f RNGfns.f
pnorm.f
 ?? ?calls RNGfns.f
rgamma.f
 ?? ?calls RNGfns.f
RNGfns.f
 ?? ?calls wrapper.c
---

My Makevars is:
---
C_OBJS = wrapper.o Nmix_init.o
FT_OBJS = Nmix-aux.o Nmix-sub3z.o RNGfns.o f2cio.o fef2cio.o pnorm.o 
rgamma2.o
all: $(SHLIB) clean
$(SHLIB): $(FT_OBJS) $(C_OBJS)

fef2cio.mod: fef2cio.o f2cio.o
Nmix-sub3z.o: f2cio.mod fef2cio.mod
clean:
 ??? @rm -rf *.mod *.o
---

What dependency am I failing to capture? Or is there some other fault in 
the Makevars? Any clues welcome!

Maybe that fef2cio.o depends on f2cio.mod

make -d might be useful for finding out what is make doing and why.

It might be easier to debug via an incremental serial build - once the 
build succeeds (e.g. by coincidence), touch specific files and run 
"make" again to see if things that should be rebuilt actually are.

What rule does Make use for the f2cio.o -> f2cio.mod transition? GNU
Make could have a built-in rule for .mod files and get confused thinking
it has a circular dependency:

Nmix/src$ make -n Nmix-sub3z.o -f Makevars
make: Circular f2cio.o <- f2cio.mod dependency dropped.
m2c    -o f2cio.o
make: Circular fef2cio.o <- fef2cio.mod dependency dropped.
m2c    -o fef2cio.o
f77   -c -o Nmix-sub3z.o Nmix-sub3z.f

In my experience, it can be easier to express the Fortran module
dependencies by lying to Make and telling it that the .o file depends
on the .o file corresponding to the .mod file, not the .mod file
itself. This way, the dependent rule shouldn't be started until the
parent rule is finished producing both files.

If you have a quick way of reproducing the problem, does it help to use

Nmix-sub3z.o: f2cio.o fef2cio.o

in your dependencies and avoid mentioning *.mod at all?

Message-ID: <25163.15641.715595.766989@rob.eddelbuettel.com>


Is anybody else looking into trying to come to terms with MXE for
cross-compiling for UCRT for R 4.2.0 and its updated Windows toolchain?  I
have been bugging Tomas in private email for a bit and figured it might be
useful to spread the load a little.

Is anybody else looking into this?  Any interest in pooling resources around
some virtual meeting place? New mailing list? Or an ad-hoc slack (or channel
on existing one)?

Dirk

PS My current status:
- MXE installed on Ubuntu as cross-compilation. Pretty straightforward.
- One initial test build (using cmake) failed:
     fatal error: Windows.h: No such file or directory
- Another of a known cmake-using library (nlopt) succeeded. Good.

It might be you will have to patch the software for this one (to 
"windows.h"). Some software doesn't get regularly built on case 
sensitive filesystems.

See the "src" directory of MXE, grepping the ".patch" files,
grep Windows\.h *patch

for adaptations that had to be done for some software already

I am happy to help if you run into specific issues. If you decided to 
build SWI Prolog in the end from source, please note I've recently added 
a host build of cmake to Rtools42. The Berkeley db is part of MXE and 
can trivially be added to Rtools42 if you need it (simply would be 
listed in settings.mk, running "make db" succeeds on my system, 
producing libdb.a). Libuuid is already part of Rtools42.

Dear Tomas,

Wow, thanks! Having cmake is, of course, a great improvement, of use for many people. Thanks a lot!

Message-ID: <ddcff059-5672-eb28-0a71-93955e4ac859@gmail.com>

   I'm sure I'm doing something silly, but I've recently started having 
a problem building vignettes (with R Under development (unstable) 
(2022-04-05 r82094) -- "Unsuffered Consequences")

   Is anyone else seeing this?

$ R CMD build broom.mixed
* checking for file ?broom.mixed/DESCRIPTION? ... OK
* preparing ?broom.mixed?:
* checking DESCRIPTION meta-information ... OK
* installing the package to build vignettes
* creating vignettes ...Error in find_vignette_product(name, by = 
"weave", dir = docdir, engine = engine) :
   Failed to locate ?weave? output file ?broom_mixed_intro.pdf? or 
?broom_mixed_intro.html? for vignette with name ?broom_mixed_intro? and 
engine ?utils::Sweave?. The following files exist in working directory 
?/tmp/Rtmp7rjAe4/Rbuild3978f3146b8cd8/broom.mixed/vignettes?: 
?broom_mixed_intro.rmd? (6322 bytes)
Execution halted

   The weird thing here is that I don't see why R is trying to use 
utils::Sweave ?  The DESCRIPTION file has VignetteBuilder: knitr and the 
head of the vignette file has

vignette: >
   %\VignetteIndexEntry{introduction to broom.mixed}
   %\VignetteEngine{knitr::rmarkdown}
   \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

  ...

  I could swear this used to work ...

   cheers

   Follow-up: the problem goes away if I revert from SVN r82094 to 
r81000.  Will try some more bisection ...

Thanks for the suggestions, I've rewritten the paragraphs, biasing 
towards users who have UTF-8 as the native encoding as this is going to 
be the majority. These users should not have to worry much about the 
encoding marks anymore, nor about the internal UTF-8 mode of the 
connections code. But the level of detail I think needs to remain as 
long as these features are supported - the level of detail is based on 
numerous questions and bug reports.

I wasn't able to reproduce the build failure, but the reported vignette 
engine seems to be wrong. Indeed, there was an old (2013) bug in 
tools::pkgVignettes() that caused the reported engine in that error 
message to *always* be 'utils::Sweave'. I have just fixed that in 
R-devel (c82097, also ported to R-alpha, to be rebuilt in a few hours) 
but that won't solve the build failure itself.

The build failure most likely comes from

     # Rescan for weave and tangle output files
     vigns <- pkgVignettes(dir = '.', output = TRUE, source = TRUE)

after "successful" (only in the sense of not throwing an error) 
'buildVignettes(dir = '.', tangle = TRUE)', where 'dir' is the package 
source directory. Running these commands (from library("tools")) 
interactively should help debugging the problem at your end. From the 
error message it seems that buildVignettes() did not produce any output 
files.

Thanks to the ubiquity of Excel and its misguided inclusion of BOM codes in its UTF-8 CSV format, this optimism about encoding being a corner case seems premature. There are actually multiple options in Excel for writing CSV files, and only one of them (not the first one fortunately) has this "feature", but I (and various beginners I end up helping) seem to encounter these silly files far more frequently than seems reasonable.

There are actually multiple options in Excel for writing CSV files, and only one of them (not the first one fortunately) has this "feature", but I (and various beginners I end up helping) seem to encounter these silly files far more frequently than seems reasonable.

I was rather referring to encoding marks in R which declare an encoding 
of an R string, that is what you see by Encoding(). And to other 
measures to avoid the problem when the native encoding in R cannot 
represent all characters users need to work with (when the native 
encoding cannot be UTF-8). From R 4.2, the native encoding will be UTF-8 
also on (recent) Windows systems; on most Unix systems, it has been 
UTF-8 for years. But this change will not impact the handling of BOMs in 
input.

Is the problem reading CSV files from Excel (even when Excel is at 
fault) reported anywhere? If not, please report, maybe there is 
something that could be done to help processing those files on the R 
side. R handles BOMs in the "connections" code, ?connections, and it 
uses iconv for input conversion.

Thanks
Tomas

Of course, all these features have their use cases and it's important
to stay backwards compatible, including the documentation.

I would also like to apologise to Dan for leading him on a wild goose
chase that didn't bring him passing read.csv-related tests in the end.

   Follow-up.

* I was wrong about the reversion to an earlier SVN commit helping

* Sebastian Meyer provided **enormously** useful feedback in telling me 
that these are the steps required to replicate what "R CMD build" is 
doing internally when it fails

   tools::buildVignettes(dir = ".", tangle = TRUE)
   vigns <- tools::pkgVignettes(dir = '.', output = TRUE, source = TRUE)

* running this code interactively allowed me to see that my build was 
failing with these errors:

Error: processing vignette 'lmer.Rnw' failed with diagnostics:
Running 'texi2dvi' on 'lmer.tex' failed.
LaTeX errors:
! Package inputenc Error: Unicode character ? (U+250C)
(inputenc)                not set up for use with LaTeX.

* further digging showed that for some reason I **absolutely still do 
not understand**, a simple Rnw chunk that printed a data frame was for 
some reason finding a 'huxtable' package printing method and trying to 
print the table using weird Unicode outline characters (e.g. the U+250C 
complained about above was being used as a box-corner character)

* I still don't really understand what's going on, but I'm getting there ...

Hi Matthias,

please see https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/howto-R-4.2.html 
and look for cmake, there is now a simple example for native (and 
cross-) compilation. Though your case might be harder and if you run 
into problems, please let me know.

Please use "cmake" that is on PATH with Rtools42 (currently it is under 
x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix). It will use "Unix Makefiles" by 
default and you can assume it is available. It will find headers and 
libraries from Rtools42 as needed.

If your installation of Rtools42 doesn't have cmake, please upgrade it.

Best
Tomas

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Possible Tinytex issue on CRAN Windows machines
Message-ID: <CAKmJU=7t01m3xoaVwuvaMuY=L-01Rvhse6mW3Q_RAXLK7LG9bg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I attempted to submit an update for a CRAN package fairadapt
<https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/fairadapt/index.html> (version
0.2.2). When running checks locally (OS X, R 4.1.0) and/or on Github CI
workflows, there are no errors or warnings appearing. Furthermore, when
running checks on win-builder provided by R-project, all the checks are
successful, both for R-devel (see log
<https://win-builder.r-project.org/0Y3mj5lAiSA9/00check.log>) and R-release
(see log <https://win-builder.r-project.org/9BmncrRlr17N/00check.log>).

However, when submitting to CRAN, an error in rebuilding the vignette pops
up on Windows (the log
<https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/fairadapt_0.2.2_20220408_111131/Windows/00check.log>
is
here). The source code in the vignette that causes the issue is here
<https://github.com/dplecko/fairadapt/blob/26a1ae735abfb018a696cb32430fc6ff85b7fca4/vignettes/jss.Rmd#L307-L354>.
On linux there are no issues (log
<https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/fairadapt_0.2.2_20220408_111131/Debian/00check.log>).
Also, in the previous CRAN release of the package, the same code did not
cause any issues on Windows.

The problem could be due to an outdated installation of Tinytex on the CRAN
machines (the issue <https://github.com/yihui/tinytex/issues/293> appeared
last year around 1st of April). However, without being able to reproduce
the problem, it is very difficult to solve it.

Would anyone have a suggestion on whether this is a "false positive" check?
Otherwise, any pointers on how to troubleshoot such a problem in general
would be really welcome.

Thank you in advance,
Drago
