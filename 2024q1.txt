No and no:

1.
       user system elapsed
IOPS 10.06   3.35   35.04

suggests that either the machines this ran on is heavily loaded (so that 
elapsed >> user) or something is waiting like some internet access. [For 
multithreading it would be user > elapsed.]

2. The solution is not to exclude examples ebtirely, as we need runtime 
checks.

For internet access: Set a timeout and let the exampe fail gracefully in 
case web access takes more than, e.g., 2. sec.

In general: Please reduce each example to less than 5 sec.

So use small toy examples. If you really want to add rel world examples 
that may take longer, then add them in addition to toy examples and wrap 
in \donttest{}.

Best,

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] how to use pkgdown::build_site() with a project using
 S7 with a specialized plot()?
Message-ID: <99119974-B153-4584-A974-C4E423D3DB83@dal.ca>

# Question

Is there an online example online of specializing `plot()` for S7 objects, such that `pkgdown::build_site()` will produce webpages?  I ask because I find lots of users (of other packages) tend to consult websites made with pkgdown, rather than using the online help within R.  I think the problem I am having (discussed in the following sections) has to do with my specialization of plot().  I say that because when I was using S3 objects in an earlier version of my package, `pkgdown::build_site()` worked as intended.

# Background

In my 'mooring' package (https://github.com/dankelley/mooring/tree/S7), I am writing code like (https://github.com/dankelley/mooring/blob/f70b53ca12e88968f65710c205b50a64f750a99d/R/plot.R#L69)

```R
#' @aliases plot.mooring
#' ETC
`plot.mooring::mooring` <- plot(ETC) ETC
```

to handle objects made with (https://github.com/dankelley/mooring/blob/f70b53ca12e88968f65710c205b50a64f750a99d/R/oo.R#L2)

```R
mooringS7 <- S7::new_class("mooring",
    package = "mooring",
ETC
```

Built up in Rstudio, with Roxygen2 being used to create documentation, things seem to work, e.g.

```R
m <- mooring(anchor(), wire(length = 80), float(), waterDepth = 100)
plot(m)
```

produces a plot as intended, and

```R
?plot.mooring
```

produces documentation as intended.

*However* I encounter a problem comes when I try building a website with

```R
pkgdown::build_site()
```

This yields results as in the next section.  (I apologize for the length. I'm including the whole thing because I thought that would be less bothersome than writing another email to the list.)

I am not sure how to find the problem, and so I hope that someone on this list can point out an example of how to set up `plot()` to work with S7 objects, in such a way that documentation can be created with Roxygen2 and websites can be made with `pkgdown::build_site()`.

Interesting that the actual error messages seem to be completely
empty.

By chance (I was searching for "rlang See `$stdout` for standard
output" because I was curious to know what is this error message
telling the user to subset) I found a bug report that seems relevant
(as it's also about S7, has the same warning and crashes in the same
call to rlang::check_installed):
https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2186

Unfortunately, there's no solution, just two similar-looking cases.

Is there an equivalent of options(error = recover) for callr child
processes? If you can recover the expression evaluated by the child
process, it could be worth executing it directly and walking the call
stack looking at the local variables at the time of the crash.

Message-ID: <CAL3ufUJs8qG7KOuX3q2T_VPavwsAhNkrvC79pk70KEq_wVZVKQ@mail.gmail.com>

I have a scenario where I have an exported function that requires the
installation a package that *is not* available on CRAN. The body of the
function is generally:

fx <- function() {
  rlang::check_installed("noncranpkg")
  noncranpkg::gx()
}

As required, this package is in the Suggests field. But this results in a
note:

checking package dependencies ... NOTE
Package suggested but not available for checking: ?noncranpkg?

Can this be safely ignored?

Uwe said yes, and he's an authority.  But for your users, it might be 
nice to include an Additional_repositories field so they can find the 
package.  This needs to be organized as an actual repository; the drat 
package is a very convenient way to set one up.

This bug is fixed in the dev version (I don?t remember off the top of my
head in which of pkgdown and roxygen2 you need but it might be both). I?m

Thanks for elaborating, yes of course, people have to declare where to 
get the package from. The note from above is still unavoidable in that case.

Thanks, both. I'm not familiar with Additional_repositories. Must the
package source be specified there? Or can it be specified via documentation
a la Rd file?

 how to use pkgdown::build_site() with a project using
 S7 with a specialized plot()?

Thanks.  I installed the latest roxygen2 and pkgdown, and tried to make a simple reprex
git clone https://github.com/dankelley/mooring.git
cd mooring
git checkout S7
Rscript -e "pkgdown::clean_site()"
Rscript -e "pkgdown::build_site()"

but it still fails.  (Full output is below, for completeness.) I wonder whether I ought to be doing something extra in the Roxygen code (in file R/plot.R within this directory.). Please note that I can rename it as "draw()" or something, but I'm hoping to learn S7 properly, because I'm really quite keen to leave my S3 and S4 days behind me.  (PS to Hadley: I loved the presentation you gave on what was then R7, and have recommended it to colleagues not just for the R7 information, but for the concise explanation of the benefit of OOP and generics.)

This bug is fixed in the dev version (I don?t remember off the top of my head in which of pkgdown and roxygen2 you need but it might be both). I?m planning CRAN updates for both in the near future.

# Question

Is there an online example online of specializing `plot()` for S7 objects, such that `pkgdown::build_site()` will produce webpages?  I ask because I find lots of users (of other packages) tend to consult websites made with pkgdown, rather than using the online help within R.  I think the problem I am having (discussed in the following sections) has to do with my specialization of plot().  I say that because when I was using S3 objects in an earlier version of my package, `pkgdown::build_site()` worked as intended.

# Background

In my 'mooring' package (https://github.com/dankelley/mooring/tree/S7), I am writing code like (https://github.com/dankelley/mooring/blob/f70b53ca12e88968f65710c205b50a64f750a99d/R/plot.R#L69)

```R
#' @aliases plot.mooring
#' ETC
`plot.mooring::mooring` <- plot(ETC) ETC
```

to handle objects made with (https://github.com/dankelley/mooring/blob/f70b53ca12e88968f65710c205b50a64f750a99d/R/oo.R#L2)

```R
mooringS7 <- S7::new_class("mooring",
    package = "mooring",
ETC
```

Built up in Rstudio, with Roxygen2 being used to create documentation, things seem to work, e.g.

```R
m <- mooring(anchor(), wire(length = 80), float(), waterDepth = 100)
plot(m)
```

produces a plot as intended, and

```R
?plot.mooring
```

produces documentation as intended.

*However* I encounter a problem comes when I try building a website with

```R
pkgdown::build_site()
```

This yields results as in the next section.  (I apologize for the length. I'm including the whole thing because I thought that would be less bothersome than writing another email to the list.)

I am not sure how to find the problem, and so I hope that someone on this list can point out an example of how to set up `plot()` to work with S7 objects, in such a way that documentation can be created with Roxygen2 and websites can be made with `pkgdown::build_site()`.

 From the CRAN polcies:

"Packages on which a CRAN package depends should be available from a 
mainstream repository: if any mentioned in ?Suggests? or ?Enhances? 
fields are not from such a repository, where to obtain them at a 
repository should be specified in an ?Additional_repositories? field of 
the DESCRIPTION file (as a comma-separated list of repository URLs) or 
for other means of access, described in the ?Description? field. "

Best,
Uwe Ligges

Did you re-document? You?ll need that to correctly regenerate the .Rd, I
think. (Sorry I?m on vacation so I?m guessing at stuff from my phone)

Oh, Hadley, I'm sorry to bother you whilst you're on vacation.  Please don't take too much time on.  I'm certainly not in a rush at all.

To answer your question, yes, I rebuilt the documentation (within RStudio, via the 'More/Document' scheme) and it still fails.

I wonder if I need to do a

method(plot, mooring:::mooringS7) <- function(ETC) {ETC}

instead of

`plot.mooring::mooring` <- function(ETC) {ETC}

which is what I'm doing now, and which works for plotting but not webpage-building.

PS. That `mooringS7` vs `mooring` name difference is because I am using

mooringS7 <- S7::new_class("mooring", ETC

because I want the user-facing function to be called `mooring`.  (I am having the user using the object constructor directly.  I guess I could, but I'm doing it this way to retain my old code, which used S3 methodology and had a fair bit of logic before constructing a return value.  I can change that, of course.  For now, my S7 steps are a bit timid, so I can fall back to my S3 code if I cannot figure things out.)

Did you re-document? You?ll need that to correctly regenerate the .Rd, I think. (Sorry I?m on vacation so I?m guessing at stuff from my phone)

This bug is fixed in the dev version (I don?t remember off the top of my head in which of pkgdown and roxygen2 you need but it might be both). I?m planning CRAN updates for both in the near future.

# Question

Is there an online example online of specializing `plot()` for S7 objects, such that `pkgdown::build_site()` will produce webpages?  I ask because I find lots of users (of other packages) tend to consult websites made with pkgdown, rather than using the online help within R.  I think the problem I am having (discussed in the following sections) has to do with my specialization of plot().  I say that because when I was using S3 objects in an earlier version of my package, `pkgdown::build_site()` worked as intended.

# Background

In my 'mooring' package (https://github.com/dankelley/mooring/tree/S7), I am writing code like (https://github.com/dankelley/mooring/blob/f70b53ca12e88968f65710c205b50a64f750a99d/R/plot.R#L69)

```R
#' @aliases plot.mooring
#' ETC
`plot.mooring::mooring` <- plot(ETC) ETC
```

to handle objects made with (https://github.com/dankelley/mooring/blob/f70b53ca12e88968f65710c205b50a64f750a99d/R/oo.R#L2)

```R
mooringS7 <- S7::new_class("mooring",
    package = "mooring",
ETC
```

Built up in Rstudio, with Roxygen2 being used to create documentation, things seem to work, e.g.

```R
m <- mooring(anchor(), wire(length = 80), float(), waterDepth = 100)
plot(m)
```

produces a plot as intended, and

```R
?plot.mooring
```

produces documentation as intended.

*However* I encounter a problem comes when I try building a website with

```R
pkgdown::build_site()
```

This yields results as in the next section.  (I apologize for the length. I'm including the whole thing because I thought that would be less bothersome than writing another email to the list.)

I am not sure how to find the problem, and so I hope that someone on this list can point out an example of how to set up `plot()` to work with S7 objects, in such a way that documentation can be created with Roxygen2 and websites can be made with `pkgdown::build_site()`.

Answering my own question here ...

The problem was that I was using

	mooringS7 <- S7::new_class("mooring", ETC

instead of

	mooringS7 <- S7::new_class("mooringS7", ETC

With the change to the latter, all works fine now.  Thanks very much to all who have helped, so generously and so quickly.  

I wish a very Happy New Year, to all!!

I ask because I find lots of users (of other packages) tend to consult websites made with pkgdown, rather than using the online help within R.  I think the problem I am having (discussed in the following sections) has to do with my specialization of plot().  I say that because when I was using S3 objects in an earlier version of my package, `pkgdown::build_site()` worked as intended.

I understand that perfectly, but for instance my package declared already
has over 800 tests and 100% code coverage. More unit testing in the
vignettes really strikes as unnecessary.

One other reason to use a static vignette, in my case, is that package
Sweave is not available for my version of R (on MacOS, M2 version)

Yes indeed, I know about R.rsp.
To me at least, zero dependency means that users install that package and
that package alone, the reason for which I am now looking for static
(preferably html) vignettes.

I guess another question is why should the "Suggests" packages need to be
installed by end users. I understand CRAN checks need to make sure the
Vignettes can be processed and the code inside runs fine (just like the
examples in the Rd files) but it is very unlikely that end-users will want
to compile the vignettes themselves.

From my own experience of almost 20 years of using R, I never-ever build
the vignettes of a certain package because it is much simpler to read them
on CRAN. I wonder, then, why are end users forced to install
Vignette-building "Suggests" packages (with long dependency chains) when
they practically never do that.

Life would be much simpler if the Suggests packages would not be
(automatically) installed, or if CRAN provided a way to include static
Vignettes to avoid the heavy dependencies of building them.

Best regards,
Adrian

As far as I know, there is no package called Sweave, there's just the 
Sweave() function in the utils package.>

Users aren't forced to install "Suggests" packages.  That's a choice 
they make.  The default for `install.packages()` is `dependencies = NA`, 
which says to install hard dependencies (Imports, Depends, LinkingTo).
Users have to choose a non-default setting to include Suggests.

Also note that the maintainer builds the vignette whe calling
R CMD build
CRAN checks whether the vignette can be build.
If a user installs a package, the already produced vignette (on the 
maintainers machine by R CMD build) is instaled. There is no need for 
the user to install any extra package for being able to look at the 
vignettes.

Best,

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Assigning an object to the global environment (shiny
 package)
Message-ID: <CAMyz+tW8yVq5GEDG31aQmL39QCUeAXyVH1=Nhb5baEWyCq8pqg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone!
I which a happy new year!


I'm coding a shiny app and I would like to include an option so that the
users can assign the results to the global environment for further analysis.

I have written the following code, which checks if 'globalvarname' (the
name of object to be created in the global environment) already exists,
returning an error if so, and asking to the user change the name.

code
-----------
observeEvent(input$savetoglobalenv, {
 ### more code here

  if (exists(input$globalvarname, envir = globalenv())) {
    sendSweetAlert(
      session = session,
      title = "Error",
      text = paste0("The object'", input$globalvarname, "' already exists
in the global environment. Please, change the name."),
      type = "success"
    )
  } else {
    assign(input$globalvarname, report, envir = globalenv())
    ask_confirmation(
      inputId = "myconfirmation",
      type = "warning",
      title = "Close the App?",
      text = paste0("The object'", input$globalvarname, "' has been created
in the Global environment. To access the created object, you need first to
stop the App. Do you really want to close the app now?"),
      btn_labels = c("Nope", "Yep"),
      btn_colors = c("#FE642E", "#04B404")
    )
  }
})
---------

Thus, the object is only created when the user decides to assign such an
object to the global environment. As the object's name is checked, there is
no way of replacing some object already available in the global environment.

Of course, when running devtools::check(), a NOTE is returned

Found the following assignments to the global environment:
  Arquivo 'plimanshiny/R/mod_analyze.R':

Can I ignore this safely?
Is there any suggestion to handly this without using 'assign()'

Thanks in advance,
Olivoto

You cannot and should not ignore this.

An R package should never ever be assigning variables into environments for
which they haven't been granted permission to do so. You should ask the
user whether they want the object assigned in the global environment before
doing so, and the default should be no so that it will not be assigned in
non interactive sessions.

A simple alternative would be to assign it into a private environment 
managed by your app, and supply a function to the user to retrieve it 
from there.  The user can choose where to assign the result of that 
function.

So instead of:

   user says to save to "myvar"
   you save to myvar
   user uses myvar

you would have

   user says to save value
   you save it privately
   user runs myvar <- savedvalue()

If your app requires users to be able to save several different values, 
the user could enter a name on the first line and enter it again on the 
third line.

I understand that this doesn't actually *solve *your problem, but would
like to offer an alternative perspective.

I often find that vignettes may be most useful as an extended form of
documentation. If you have a pkgdown site, you can use
`usethis::use_article()` to create an article which will not be included as
part of the package itself but will be served in the documentation site of
the package. I don't think many people consume extended package
documentation through vignettes all that much but often prefer to rely on
the package website. Using the article format means that your package tests
on CRAN will not be subjected to any other packages used in the articles or
vignettes.

Cheers!

Alternatively, you can create a new environment in your package and assign
into it and fetch out of it. This is definitely safer and probably "more
idiomatic." Hope that helps!


# create a new environment

I see... then I must have tested with dependencies = TRUE thinking this
refers to hard dependencies (one more reason to read the documentation
properly).

Thank you,

Good day

I think I finally have a final package that only yields the expected 'New
submission' note.
The package is available at:
https://github.com/WoutersResearchGroup/R-IO-PS/tree/CRAN-prep.

Is there a way to confirm that this package is ready for submission?
I submitted it to https://win-builder.r-project.org/ and
https://mac.r-project.org/macbuilder/submit.html and
https://builder.r-hub.io/. All of these seem to only show the expected new
submission note.

I see the CRAN package submission web form is unavailable until the 8th, so
any confirmation that my package should be fine for submission would be
appreciated.

Thank you
Christiaan

Congratulations! I also get the single expected NOTE in my checks.

This may be your last chance to rename the package from iopspackage to,
say, "IOPS". If you go over the package and the CRAN policy at
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html> one last time
and deem the package compliant, it should be ready for submission.

The CRAN reviewer may find additional problems and ask you to fix them,
but you are likely most of the way there.

Apologies for the double e-mail, but I've read the code now, and
wrapping the example of your only function in \dontrun{} will most
likely not be allowed.

Is it really the case that you cannot remove a single row from the
example dataset without making the example crash? It may help to write
a function that would remove rows one by one, make sure that the
example still runs, and keep doing that until not a single row can be
removed. The complexity is terrible (something like O(n^k)), but let it
run for a while, and maybe it'll reduce the dataset enough to fit in
the example time limit.

I may add two cents on that as we recently made this change in data.table.
Using markdown package instead of rmarkdown as a vignette engine reduced
burden caused by extra dependencies tremendously. Moreover it made package
to not even need c++ compiler, as knitr and markdown both (and their
recursive deps) are pure C with no C++.
Gains were huge. Deps installation time from 12min to 30sec. CI pipeline
compute minutes saving around 100min on a single workflow.

But there is even a better news (so be sure to upvote), that knitr may not
be required to render Rmd at all in near future. For details see

Good day

I have edited my package to have two examples. One uses a small
self-generated dataset and another uses a big dataset. For the big dataset
example, I put \donttest{} around it, should this be fine?

I only get one note for the new package, available at
https://github.com/WoutersResearchGroup/R-IO-PS/tree/CRAN-prep.

Kind regards
Christiaan

The small example is definitely fine: it exercises the code and does so
fast.

The big example wrapped in \donttest{} could be fine, I'm not sure.
I've seen CRAN packages that wrap the long parts of their examples in
\donttest{} while still making sure that R CMD check --run-donttest
exercises most of their code.

Subject: [Rd] using Paraview "in-situ" with R?

I had previously asked about R interfaces to various "other" visualization
tools specifically lightweights for monitoring progress of
various codes. I was working on this,

https://github.com/mmarchywka/mjmdatascope

but in the meantime found out that Paraview has an "in-situ"
capability for similar objectives.

https://discourse.paraview.org/t/does-or-can-paraview-support-streaming-input/13637/9

While R does have a lot of plotting features,
it seems like an excellent tool to interface to R allowing visualization without
a bunch of temp files or

Is anyone aware of anyone doing this interface or reasons its  a boondoggle?

Thanks.

Thanks, all. As it goes, the package submission failed. The package that is
suggested is available at https://r.esri.com/bin/ and as such provided `
https://r.esri.com` as the url in `Additional_repositories`.

The request was to remove the additional repositories and provide
instructions for package installation in the Description field. This
package, arcgisbinding, is used in one line of the entire package
https://github.com/R-ArcGIS/arcgisutils/blob/64093dc1a42fa28010cd45bb6ae8b8c57835cb40/R/arc-auth.R#L123
to extract an authorization token. It is provided for compatibility with a
semi-closed-source R package. The installation instructions for which
are....lengthy (
https://r.esri.com/r-bridge-site/arcgisbinding/installing-arcgisbinding.html)
and *only *available as a windows binary. Providing an explicit call
out for installation in the "Description" field of the DESCRIPTION feels
like it is co-opting the Description to describe the installation process
for a function that I anticipate *very few *people to use.

Is there another approach that can be taken here? The one requested feels
like an incorrect use of the description field because it no longer
describes the package but how to handle one very rare edge case.

There is no

https://r.esri.com/src

hence it is obviously not a standard repository.

It is provided for compatibility with a semi-closed-source R package. The installation instructions for which are....lengthy (https://r.esri.com/r-bridge-site/arcgisbinding/installing-arcgisbinding.html <https://r.esri.com/r-bridge-site/arcgisbinding/installing-arcgisbinding.html>) and /only /available as a windows binary. Providing an explicit call out?for installation in the "Description" field of the DESCRIPTION feels like it is co-opting the Description to describe the installation process for a function that I anticipate /very few /people to use.

So you can either remove the need for that package or say something like 
".... and if an authorization token is to be extracted on Windows, the 
'arcgisbinding' package is needed that can be installed as explained at 
<https://r.esri.com>."

CRAN-like repository looks like unless you have an intimate knowledge of
CRAN's structure.

Regardless, thank you for the feedback! I'll adjust the description file.

A repository r that works with

install.packages(......., repos=r)

i.e. needs PACKAGES files and sources/binaries in relevant directories 
such as
./src (at least)
and ideally also
./bin/windows/contrib/4.2/
./bin/windows/contrib/4.3/
./bin/windows/contrib/4.4/
and similarly for mac.

Best,
Uwe Ligges

   for other R users. However, such packages can be large enough to exceed
   the package size limit (5 megabytes) for the Comprehen sive R Archive
   Network (CRAN). As an alternative, large data packages can be posted to
   additional repostiories beyond CRAN itself in a way that allows smaller
   code packages on CRAN to access and use the data. The drat package
   facilitates creation and use of such alternative repositories and makes it
   particularly simple to host them via GitHub. CRAN packages can draw on
   packages posted to drat repositories through the use of the
   ?Additonal_repositories? field in the DESCRIPTION file. This paper
   describes how R users can create a suite of coordinated packages, in which
   larger data packages are hosted in an alternative repository created with
   drat, while a smaller code package that interacts with this data is
   created that can be submitted to CRAN.

I don't see a source package there, only .zip files.  Those are only 
going to work on Windows, and only on the R versions you've prepared it 
for.  If the suggested package is only on that platform, I'd suggest 
removing it from "Suggests", and just describe what it does and how to 
use it in a vignette or help page.

If you really want to keep it in Suggests, but don't want to describe 
installation in the way that was recommended to you, then take the other 
route, and put it in an "Additional_repositories" repository as I 
suggested last week -- but this time make sure to use a properly 
formatted repository, not just a web site with some binary builds.  The 
"drat" package makes building one of those really easy.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] "Examples with CPU time > 2.5 times elapsed time" and
 other NOTEs on CRAN and rhub checks
Message-ID: <AS8PR03MB101194981649434A5F83AB8A1D3682@AS8PR03MB10119.eurprd03.prod.outlook.com>

Hi all,
I submitted my package RITCH (https://github.com/DavZim/RITCH) to CRAN (used to be archived but I wanted to revive it again) but I got a NOTE (Question 1 below). Besides this NOTE from CRAN, I got two other NOTEs from rhub (Q2 and Q3).

Q1) The CRAN NOTE (Debian only, does not surface on Windows or other platforms) reads

*checking examples ... [7s/3s] NOTE
Examples with CPU time > 2.5 times elapsed time
                              user system elapsed ratio
read_functions 3.968  0.092   0.831 4.886
(https://github.com/DavZim/RITCH/blob/master/R/read_functions.R in case you need the source code, the full CRAN report can be found here https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/RITCH_0.1.23_20240110_120457/Debian/00check.log)

The package itself has no parallelism built-in, but Imports data.table. This NOTE does not surface on other platforms (eg using rhub or on my GitHub actions runners). My unit tests already limit data.table to 2 cores using setDTthreads(2), but I would like to keep this line out of the help files for my functions.
Is there anything that I can do or can I ignore the result and argue for an exception using the false positive argument?

Q2) A second question that I have is that on rhub Ubuntu Linux 20.04.1 LTS, R-release, GCC (https://artifacts.r-hub.io/RITCH_0.1.22.tar.gz-d2b925faf6b24497abbfa6ff60e51d34/RITCH.Rcheck/00check.log) I receive the NOTE that my libs/ sub-directory is at 7.7Mb. Can I ignore this or do I need to figure out how to reduce the binary size of the package?

* checking installed package size ... NOTE
  installed size is  8.6Mb
  sub-directories of 1Mb or more:
    libs   7.7Mb

My code uses Rcpp and has some classes and interdependencies between C++ functions, therefore a rewrite to make the binary size smaller might take a lot of work. From looking around online I find that other packages are a lot bigger. Are there any low-hanging fruits that I can use to reduce the size or should I ignore this NOTE?

Q3) And last but not least, on some rhub instances (Fedora and Ubuntu GCC) I receive a NOTE that the package runs its examples too slowly (eg above 5secs). I have already tweaked the example code already that it runs reliably <4 secs on my development laptop

Ubuntu Linux 20.04.1 LTS, R-release, GCC (https://builder.r-hub.io/status/original/RITCH_0.1.22.tar.gz-d2b925faf6b24497abbfa6ff60e51d34)
* checking examples ... [6s/37s] NOTE
Examples with CPU (user + system) or elapsed time > 5s
               user system elapsed
read_functions 2.51  0.028   12.57

and on Fedora Linux, R-devel, clang, gfortran (https://builder.r-hub.io/status/original/RITCH_0.1.22.tar.gz-01bf475551eb4b30a722ea79ce421788)

* checking examples ... [6s/26s] NOTE
Examples with CPU (user + system) or elapsed time > 5s
                user system elapsed
read_functions 1.896  0.018   8.891

As this does not surface on the CRAN checks, I would ignore it for now and concentrate only on the CRAN checks. Is this correct or should I pay more attention to these NOTEs?

Any help/comment is appreciated.

Thank you for your time and best regards,
David

A breakpoint on pthread_create confirms that these are OpenMP threads
created by data.table. You can wrap setDTthreads(2) in \dontshow{} to
avoid visual pollution:

I think this is typically accepted for packages using C++.

Then it should be fine.

Additionally, you may need to cast some of your Rprintf arguments to
avoid format warnings on Windows:

Message-ID: <9d76dc3b-9f7b-4883-a866-221e46991e15@stkpp.org>

I'm the mainteneur of the package MixAll.

This package has a dependency to the package rtkore (whom I'm the mainteneur too).
I updated the package rtkore one month ago, fixing a compilation problem on windows devel platform.

MixAll has a dependency to rtkore. Thus, I suspect that the error reported below is due to
the presence of the old version of rtkore on the pretest infrastructure of the CRAN.

My question: is-it possible to know what is the version of rtkore installed on this pretest platform ?
(and the https://win-builder.r-project.org/ site too, as I get the same error on this site).
Il would certainly save me many tries, my suspicion should be true.

Thanks,
Serge

I don't know if you can find out which rtkore version was installed, but 
your package should work with any rtkore version if you haven't declared 
a dependency on a particular version.  So the simplest thing is just to 
declare that you depend on "rtkore (>= x.y.z)" where x.y.z has the 
recent fix.

The "Bad address" here means that /bin/sh got an EFAULT while trying to
launch g++.exe:

Unless there is something extremely weird in the command line arguments
returned by Rscript -e "rtkore:::CxxFlags()" that causes the process to
fail to launch (in my opinion, very unlikely, but can you print them
from your compilation process just in case?), I would be looking for
problems elsewhere.

In particular, the problem cannot be in having rtkore installed that is
one version too old, because you only changed Makevars in that version,
and your package MixAll doesn't use the Makevars from a different
source package.

Hi Ivan,

After somme minor midficiations, I make a try on the winbuilder site.
I was able to build the archive with the static library
but I get again a Bad address error. You can have a look to

https://win-builder.r-project.org/bw47qsMX3HTd/00install.out

Thanks for your help,
Serge

I think that Win-Builder is running out of memory. It took some
experimenting, but I was able to reproduce something like this using
the following:

1. Set the swap file in the Windows settings to minimal recommended
size and disable its automatic growth

2. Write and run a program that does malloc(LARGE_NUMBER); getchar();
so that almost all physical memory is allocated

3. Run gcc -DFOO=`/path/to/Rscript -e 'some script'` & many times

I got a lot of interesting errors, including the "Bad address":

Warnings:
1: .getGeneric(f, , package) : internal error -4 in R_decompress1
2: package "methods" in options("defaultPackages") was not found

0 [main] bash (2892) child_copy: cygheap read copy failed,
0x0..0x800025420, done 0, windows pid 2892, Win32 error 299

0 [main] bash (3256) C:\rtools43\usr\bin\bash.exe: *** fatal error in
forked process - MEM_COMMIT failed, Win32 error 1455

-bash: fork: retry: Resource temporarily unavailable

-bash: R-devel/bin/Rscript.exe: Bad address

Your package is written in C++, but that by itself shouldn't disqualify
it. On my Linux computer, /usr/bin/time R -e
'install.packages("MixAll")' says that the installation takes slightly
less than a gigabyte of memory ("912516maxresident k"), which is par
the course for such packages. (My small Rcpp-using package takes
approximately half a gigabyte by the same metric.)

I'm still not 100% sure (if Win-Builder is running out of memory, why
are you seeing "Bad address" only and not the rest of the carnage?),
but I'm not seeing a problem with your package, either. If EFAULT is
Cygwin's way of saying "I caught a bad pointer in your system call"
(which, I must stress, is happening inside /bin/sh, not your package
or even R at all), it's not impossible that Win-Builder is having
hardware problems. Unfortunately, they take a lot of effort and
downtime to diagnose and could be hiding anywhere from RAM to the power
supply.

The above indeed happens if not sufficient memory would be available.
Important to know: This includes unused but committed memory which may 
be a lot.
But I doubt it is the case on winbuilder as the machines has 256GB or 
more (depending in the machine) and additionally 500GB swap space on SSD.

Best,
Uwe

I can take a look, but not sure if I get to it before monday.
I haven't seen it for any other packages recently.

My suspicion is currently a strange mix of cmd.exe and sh.exe calls. But 
this is a very wild guess.

Best,
Uwe

Fascinating, now it worked with the latest winbuilder submission 3 times 
in a row when I checked it manually. So maybe Ivan was right and there 
was a very demanding set of other packages compiling at the same time?
I don't know.

Serge, Can you somply submit your latest winbuilder upload to CRAN?

Best,
Uwe Ligges

Thank you both very much for your feedback.
I'll submit the package tomorrow and see...
