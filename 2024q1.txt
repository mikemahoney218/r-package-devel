No and no:

1.
       user system elapsed
IOPS 10.06   3.35   35.04

suggests that either the machines this ran on is heavily loaded (so that 
elapsed >> user) or something is waiting like some internet access. [For 
multithreading it would be user > elapsed.]

2. The solution is not to exclude examples ebtirely, as we need runtime 
checks.

For internet access: Set a timeout and let the exampe fail gracefully in 
case web access takes more than, e.g., 2. sec.

In general: Please reduce each example to less than 5 sec.

So use small toy examples. If you really want to add rel world examples 
that may take longer, then add them in addition to toy examples and wrap 
in \donttest{}.

Best,

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] how to use pkgdown::build_site() with a project using
 S7 with a specialized plot()?
Message-ID: <99119974-B153-4584-A974-C4E423D3DB83@dal.ca>

# Question

Is there an online example online of specializing `plot()` for S7 objects, such that `pkgdown::build_site()` will produce webpages?  I ask because I find lots of users (of other packages) tend to consult websites made with pkgdown, rather than using the online help within R.  I think the problem I am having (discussed in the following sections) has to do with my specialization of plot().  I say that because when I was using S3 objects in an earlier version of my package, `pkgdown::build_site()` worked as intended.

# Background

In my 'mooring' package (https://github.com/dankelley/mooring/tree/S7), I am writing code like (https://github.com/dankelley/mooring/blob/f70b53ca12e88968f65710c205b50a64f750a99d/R/plot.R#L69)

```R
#' @aliases plot.mooring
#' ETC
`plot.mooring::mooring` <- plot(ETC) ETC
```

to handle objects made with (https://github.com/dankelley/mooring/blob/f70b53ca12e88968f65710c205b50a64f750a99d/R/oo.R#L2)

```R
mooringS7 <- S7::new_class("mooring",
    package = "mooring",
ETC
```

Built up in Rstudio, with Roxygen2 being used to create documentation, things seem to work, e.g.

```R
m <- mooring(anchor(), wire(length = 80), float(), waterDepth = 100)
plot(m)
```

produces a plot as intended, and

```R
?plot.mooring
```

produces documentation as intended.

*However* I encounter a problem comes when I try building a website with

```R
pkgdown::build_site()
```

This yields results as in the next section.  (I apologize for the length. I'm including the whole thing because I thought that would be less bothersome than writing another email to the list.)

I am not sure how to find the problem, and so I hope that someone on this list can point out an example of how to set up `plot()` to work with S7 objects, in such a way that documentation can be created with Roxygen2 and websites can be made with `pkgdown::build_site()`.

Interesting that the actual error messages seem to be completely
empty.

By chance (I was searching for "rlang See `$stdout` for standard
output" because I was curious to know what is this error message
telling the user to subset) I found a bug report that seems relevant
(as it's also about S7, has the same warning and crashes in the same
call to rlang::check_installed):
https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2186

Unfortunately, there's no solution, just two similar-looking cases.

Is there an equivalent of options(error = recover) for callr child
processes? If you can recover the expression evaluated by the child
process, it could be worth executing it directly and walking the call
stack looking at the local variables at the time of the crash.

Message-ID: <CAL3ufUJs8qG7KOuX3q2T_VPavwsAhNkrvC79pk70KEq_wVZVKQ@mail.gmail.com>

I have a scenario where I have an exported function that requires the
installation a package that *is not* available on CRAN. The body of the
function is generally:

fx <- function() {
  rlang::check_installed("noncranpkg")
  noncranpkg::gx()
}

As required, this package is in the Suggests field. But this results in a
note:

checking package dependencies ... NOTE
Package suggested but not available for checking: ?noncranpkg?

Can this be safely ignored?

Uwe said yes, and he's an authority.  But for your users, it might be 
nice to include an Additional_repositories field so they can find the 
package.  This needs to be organized as an actual repository; the drat 
package is a very convenient way to set one up.

This bug is fixed in the dev version (I don?t remember off the top of my
head in which of pkgdown and roxygen2 you need but it might be both). I?m

Thanks for elaborating, yes of course, people have to declare where to 
get the package from. The note from above is still unavoidable in that case.

Thanks, both. I'm not familiar with Additional_repositories. Must the
package source be specified there? Or can it be specified via documentation
a la Rd file?

 how to use pkgdown::build_site() with a project using
 S7 with a specialized plot()?

Thanks.  I installed the latest roxygen2 and pkgdown, and tried to make a simple reprex
git clone https://github.com/dankelley/mooring.git
cd mooring
git checkout S7
Rscript -e "pkgdown::clean_site()"
Rscript -e "pkgdown::build_site()"

but it still fails.  (Full output is below, for completeness.) I wonder whether I ought to be doing something extra in the Roxygen code (in file R/plot.R within this directory.). Please note that I can rename it as "draw()" or something, but I'm hoping to learn S7 properly, because I'm really quite keen to leave my S3 and S4 days behind me.  (PS to Hadley: I loved the presentation you gave on what was then R7, and have recommended it to colleagues not just for the R7 information, but for the concise explanation of the benefit of OOP and generics.)

This bug is fixed in the dev version (I don?t remember off the top of my head in which of pkgdown and roxygen2 you need but it might be both). I?m planning CRAN updates for both in the near future.

# Question

Is there an online example online of specializing `plot()` for S7 objects, such that `pkgdown::build_site()` will produce webpages?  I ask because I find lots of users (of other packages) tend to consult websites made with pkgdown, rather than using the online help within R.  I think the problem I am having (discussed in the following sections) has to do with my specialization of plot().  I say that because when I was using S3 objects in an earlier version of my package, `pkgdown::build_site()` worked as intended.

# Background

In my 'mooring' package (https://github.com/dankelley/mooring/tree/S7), I am writing code like (https://github.com/dankelley/mooring/blob/f70b53ca12e88968f65710c205b50a64f750a99d/R/plot.R#L69)

```R
#' @aliases plot.mooring
#' ETC
`plot.mooring::mooring` <- plot(ETC) ETC
```

to handle objects made with (https://github.com/dankelley/mooring/blob/f70b53ca12e88968f65710c205b50a64f750a99d/R/oo.R#L2)

```R
mooringS7 <- S7::new_class("mooring",
    package = "mooring",
ETC
```

Built up in Rstudio, with Roxygen2 being used to create documentation, things seem to work, e.g.

```R
m <- mooring(anchor(), wire(length = 80), float(), waterDepth = 100)
plot(m)
```

produces a plot as intended, and

```R
?plot.mooring
```

produces documentation as intended.

*However* I encounter a problem comes when I try building a website with

```R
pkgdown::build_site()
```

This yields results as in the next section.  (I apologize for the length. I'm including the whole thing because I thought that would be less bothersome than writing another email to the list.)

I am not sure how to find the problem, and so I hope that someone on this list can point out an example of how to set up `plot()` to work with S7 objects, in such a way that documentation can be created with Roxygen2 and websites can be made with `pkgdown::build_site()`.

 From the CRAN polcies:

"Packages on which a CRAN package depends should be available from a 
mainstream repository: if any mentioned in ?Suggests? or ?Enhances? 
fields are not from such a repository, where to obtain them at a 
repository should be specified in an ?Additional_repositories? field of 
the DESCRIPTION file (as a comma-separated list of repository URLs) or 
for other means of access, described in the ?Description? field. "

Best,
Uwe Ligges

Did you re-document? You?ll need that to correctly regenerate the .Rd, I
think. (Sorry I?m on vacation so I?m guessing at stuff from my phone)

Oh, Hadley, I'm sorry to bother you whilst you're on vacation.  Please don't take too much time on.  I'm certainly not in a rush at all.

To answer your question, yes, I rebuilt the documentation (within RStudio, via the 'More/Document' scheme) and it still fails.

I wonder if I need to do a

method(plot, mooring:::mooringS7) <- function(ETC) {ETC}

instead of

`plot.mooring::mooring` <- function(ETC) {ETC}

which is what I'm doing now, and which works for plotting but not webpage-building.

PS. That `mooringS7` vs `mooring` name difference is because I am using

mooringS7 <- S7::new_class("mooring", ETC

because I want the user-facing function to be called `mooring`.  (I am having the user using the object constructor directly.  I guess I could, but I'm doing it this way to retain my old code, which used S3 methodology and had a fair bit of logic before constructing a return value.  I can change that, of course.  For now, my S7 steps are a bit timid, so I can fall back to my S3 code if I cannot figure things out.)

Did you re-document? You?ll need that to correctly regenerate the .Rd, I think. (Sorry I?m on vacation so I?m guessing at stuff from my phone)

This bug is fixed in the dev version (I don?t remember off the top of my head in which of pkgdown and roxygen2 you need but it might be both). I?m planning CRAN updates for both in the near future.

# Question

Is there an online example online of specializing `plot()` for S7 objects, such that `pkgdown::build_site()` will produce webpages?  I ask because I find lots of users (of other packages) tend to consult websites made with pkgdown, rather than using the online help within R.  I think the problem I am having (discussed in the following sections) has to do with my specialization of plot().  I say that because when I was using S3 objects in an earlier version of my package, `pkgdown::build_site()` worked as intended.

# Background

In my 'mooring' package (https://github.com/dankelley/mooring/tree/S7), I am writing code like (https://github.com/dankelley/mooring/blob/f70b53ca12e88968f65710c205b50a64f750a99d/R/plot.R#L69)

```R
#' @aliases plot.mooring
#' ETC
`plot.mooring::mooring` <- plot(ETC) ETC
```

to handle objects made with (https://github.com/dankelley/mooring/blob/f70b53ca12e88968f65710c205b50a64f750a99d/R/oo.R#L2)

```R
mooringS7 <- S7::new_class("mooring",
    package = "mooring",
ETC
```

Built up in Rstudio, with Roxygen2 being used to create documentation, things seem to work, e.g.

```R
m <- mooring(anchor(), wire(length = 80), float(), waterDepth = 100)
plot(m)
```

produces a plot as intended, and

```R
?plot.mooring
```

produces documentation as intended.

*However* I encounter a problem comes when I try building a website with

```R
pkgdown::build_site()
```

This yields results as in the next section.  (I apologize for the length. I'm including the whole thing because I thought that would be less bothersome than writing another email to the list.)

I am not sure how to find the problem, and so I hope that someone on this list can point out an example of how to set up `plot()` to work with S7 objects, in such a way that documentation can be created with Roxygen2 and websites can be made with `pkgdown::build_site()`.

Answering my own question here ...

The problem was that I was using

	mooringS7 <- S7::new_class("mooring", ETC

instead of

	mooringS7 <- S7::new_class("mooringS7", ETC

With the change to the latter, all works fine now.  Thanks very much to all who have helped, so generously and so quickly.  

I wish a very Happy New Year, to all!!

I ask because I find lots of users (of other packages) tend to consult websites made with pkgdown, rather than using the online help within R.  I think the problem I am having (discussed in the following sections) has to do with my specialization of plot().  I say that because when I was using S3 objects in an earlier version of my package, `pkgdown::build_site()` worked as intended.

I understand that perfectly, but for instance my package declared already
has over 800 tests and 100% code coverage. More unit testing in the
vignettes really strikes as unnecessary.

One other reason to use a static vignette, in my case, is that package
Sweave is not available for my version of R (on MacOS, M2 version)

Yes indeed, I know about R.rsp.
To me at least, zero dependency means that users install that package and
that package alone, the reason for which I am now looking for static
(preferably html) vignettes.

I guess another question is why should the "Suggests" packages need to be
installed by end users. I understand CRAN checks need to make sure the
Vignettes can be processed and the code inside runs fine (just like the
examples in the Rd files) but it is very unlikely that end-users will want
to compile the vignettes themselves.

From my own experience of almost 20 years of using R, I never-ever build
the vignettes of a certain package because it is much simpler to read them
on CRAN. I wonder, then, why are end users forced to install
Vignette-building "Suggests" packages (with long dependency chains) when
they practically never do that.

Life would be much simpler if the Suggests packages would not be
(automatically) installed, or if CRAN provided a way to include static
Vignettes to avoid the heavy dependencies of building them.

Best regards,
Adrian

As far as I know, there is no package called Sweave, there's just the 
Sweave() function in the utils package.>

Users aren't forced to install "Suggests" packages.  That's a choice 
they make.  The default for `install.packages()` is `dependencies = NA`, 
which says to install hard dependencies (Imports, Depends, LinkingTo).
Users have to choose a non-default setting to include Suggests.

Also note that the maintainer builds the vignette whe calling
R CMD build
CRAN checks whether the vignette can be build.
If a user installs a package, the already produced vignette (on the 
maintainers machine by R CMD build) is instaled. There is no need for 
the user to install any extra package for being able to look at the 
vignettes.

Best,

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Assigning an object to the global environment (shiny
 package)
Message-ID: <CAMyz+tW8yVq5GEDG31aQmL39QCUeAXyVH1=Nhb5baEWyCq8pqg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone!
I which a happy new year!


I'm coding a shiny app and I would like to include an option so that the
users can assign the results to the global environment for further analysis.

I have written the following code, which checks if 'globalvarname' (the
name of object to be created in the global environment) already exists,
returning an error if so, and asking to the user change the name.

code
-----------
observeEvent(input$savetoglobalenv, {
 ### more code here

  if (exists(input$globalvarname, envir = globalenv())) {
    sendSweetAlert(
      session = session,
      title = "Error",
      text = paste0("The object'", input$globalvarname, "' already exists
in the global environment. Please, change the name."),
      type = "success"
    )
  } else {
    assign(input$globalvarname, report, envir = globalenv())
    ask_confirmation(
      inputId = "myconfirmation",
      type = "warning",
      title = "Close the App?",
      text = paste0("The object'", input$globalvarname, "' has been created
in the Global environment. To access the created object, you need first to
stop the App. Do you really want to close the app now?"),
      btn_labels = c("Nope", "Yep"),
      btn_colors = c("#FE642E", "#04B404")
    )
  }
})
---------

Thus, the object is only created when the user decides to assign such an
object to the global environment. As the object's name is checked, there is
no way of replacing some object already available in the global environment.

Of course, when running devtools::check(), a NOTE is returned

Found the following assignments to the global environment:
  Arquivo 'plimanshiny/R/mod_analyze.R':

Can I ignore this safely?
Is there any suggestion to handly this without using 'assign()'

Thanks in advance,
Olivoto

You cannot and should not ignore this.

An R package should never ever be assigning variables into environments for
which they haven't been granted permission to do so. You should ask the
user whether they want the object assigned in the global environment before
doing so, and the default should be no so that it will not be assigned in
non interactive sessions.

A simple alternative would be to assign it into a private environment 
managed by your app, and supply a function to the user to retrieve it 
from there.  The user can choose where to assign the result of that 
function.

So instead of:

   user says to save to "myvar"
   you save to myvar
   user uses myvar

you would have

   user says to save value
   you save it privately
   user runs myvar <- savedvalue()

If your app requires users to be able to save several different values, 
the user could enter a name on the first line and enter it again on the 
third line.

I understand that this doesn't actually *solve *your problem, but would
like to offer an alternative perspective.

I often find that vignettes may be most useful as an extended form of
documentation. If you have a pkgdown site, you can use
`usethis::use_article()` to create an article which will not be included as
part of the package itself but will be served in the documentation site of
the package. I don't think many people consume extended package
documentation through vignettes all that much but often prefer to rely on
the package website. Using the article format means that your package tests
on CRAN will not be subjected to any other packages used in the articles or
vignettes.

Cheers!

Alternatively, you can create a new environment in your package and assign
into it and fetch out of it. This is definitely safer and probably "more
idiomatic." Hope that helps!


# create a new environment

I see... then I must have tested with dependencies = TRUE thinking this
refers to hard dependencies (one more reason to read the documentation
properly).

Thank you,

Good day

I think I finally have a final package that only yields the expected 'New
submission' note.
The package is available at:
https://github.com/WoutersResearchGroup/R-IO-PS/tree/CRAN-prep.

Is there a way to confirm that this package is ready for submission?
I submitted it to https://win-builder.r-project.org/ and
https://mac.r-project.org/macbuilder/submit.html and
https://builder.r-hub.io/. All of these seem to only show the expected new
submission note.

I see the CRAN package submission web form is unavailable until the 8th, so
any confirmation that my package should be fine for submission would be
appreciated.

Thank you
Christiaan

Congratulations! I also get the single expected NOTE in my checks.

This may be your last chance to rename the package from iopspackage to,
say, "IOPS". If you go over the package and the CRAN policy at
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html> one last time
and deem the package compliant, it should be ready for submission.

The CRAN reviewer may find additional problems and ask you to fix them,
but you are likely most of the way there.

Apologies for the double e-mail, but I've read the code now, and
wrapping the example of your only function in \dontrun{} will most
likely not be allowed.

Is it really the case that you cannot remove a single row from the
example dataset without making the example crash? It may help to write
a function that would remove rows one by one, make sure that the
example still runs, and keep doing that until not a single row can be
removed. The complexity is terrible (something like O(n^k)), but let it
run for a while, and maybe it'll reduce the dataset enough to fit in
the example time limit.

I may add two cents on that as we recently made this change in data.table.
Using markdown package instead of rmarkdown as a vignette engine reduced
burden caused by extra dependencies tremendously. Moreover it made package
to not even need c++ compiler, as knitr and markdown both (and their
recursive deps) are pure C with no C++.
Gains were huge. Deps installation time from 12min to 30sec. CI pipeline
compute minutes saving around 100min on a single workflow.

But there is even a better news (so be sure to upvote), that knitr may not
be required to render Rmd at all in near future. For details see

Good day

I have edited my package to have two examples. One uses a small
self-generated dataset and another uses a big dataset. For the big dataset
example, I put \donttest{} around it, should this be fine?

I only get one note for the new package, available at
https://github.com/WoutersResearchGroup/R-IO-PS/tree/CRAN-prep.

Kind regards
Christiaan

The small example is definitely fine: it exercises the code and does so
fast.

The big example wrapped in \donttest{} could be fine, I'm not sure.
I've seen CRAN packages that wrap the long parts of their examples in
\donttest{} while still making sure that R CMD check --run-donttest
exercises most of their code.

Subject: [Rd] using Paraview "in-situ" with R?

I had previously asked about R interfaces to various "other" visualization
tools specifically lightweights for monitoring progress of
various codes. I was working on this,

https://github.com/mmarchywka/mjmdatascope

but in the meantime found out that Paraview has an "in-situ"
capability for similar objectives.

https://discourse.paraview.org/t/does-or-can-paraview-support-streaming-input/13637/9

While R does have a lot of plotting features,
it seems like an excellent tool to interface to R allowing visualization without
a bunch of temp files or

Is anyone aware of anyone doing this interface or reasons its  a boondoggle?

Thanks.

Thanks, all. As it goes, the package submission failed. The package that is
suggested is available at https://r.esri.com/bin/ and as such provided `
https://r.esri.com` as the url in `Additional_repositories`.

The request was to remove the additional repositories and provide
instructions for package installation in the Description field. This
package, arcgisbinding, is used in one line of the entire package
https://github.com/R-ArcGIS/arcgisutils/blob/64093dc1a42fa28010cd45bb6ae8b8c57835cb40/R/arc-auth.R#L123
to extract an authorization token. It is provided for compatibility with a
semi-closed-source R package. The installation instructions for which
are....lengthy (
https://r.esri.com/r-bridge-site/arcgisbinding/installing-arcgisbinding.html)
and *only *available as a windows binary. Providing an explicit call
out for installation in the "Description" field of the DESCRIPTION feels
like it is co-opting the Description to describe the installation process
for a function that I anticipate *very few *people to use.

Is there another approach that can be taken here? The one requested feels
like an incorrect use of the description field because it no longer
describes the package but how to handle one very rare edge case.

There is no

https://r.esri.com/src

hence it is obviously not a standard repository.

It is provided for compatibility with a semi-closed-source R package. The installation instructions for which are....lengthy (https://r.esri.com/r-bridge-site/arcgisbinding/installing-arcgisbinding.html <https://r.esri.com/r-bridge-site/arcgisbinding/installing-arcgisbinding.html>) and /only /available as a windows binary. Providing an explicit call out?for installation in the "Description" field of the DESCRIPTION feels like it is co-opting the Description to describe the installation process for a function that I anticipate /very few /people to use.

So you can either remove the need for that package or say something like 
".... and if an authorization token is to be extracted on Windows, the 
'arcgisbinding' package is needed that can be installed as explained at 
<https://r.esri.com>."

CRAN-like repository looks like unless you have an intimate knowledge of
CRAN's structure.

Regardless, thank you for the feedback! I'll adjust the description file.

A repository r that works with

install.packages(......., repos=r)

i.e. needs PACKAGES files and sources/binaries in relevant directories 
such as
./src (at least)
and ideally also
./bin/windows/contrib/4.2/
./bin/windows/contrib/4.3/
./bin/windows/contrib/4.4/
and similarly for mac.

Best,
Uwe Ligges

   for other R users. However, such packages can be large enough to exceed
   the package size limit (5 megabytes) for the Comprehen sive R Archive
   Network (CRAN). As an alternative, large data packages can be posted to
   additional repostiories beyond CRAN itself in a way that allows smaller
   code packages on CRAN to access and use the data. The drat package
   facilitates creation and use of such alternative repositories and makes it
   particularly simple to host them via GitHub. CRAN packages can draw on
   packages posted to drat repositories through the use of the
   ?Additonal_repositories? field in the DESCRIPTION file. This paper
   describes how R users can create a suite of coordinated packages, in which
   larger data packages are hosted in an alternative repository created with
   drat, while a smaller code package that interacts with this data is
   created that can be submitted to CRAN.

I don't see a source package there, only .zip files.  Those are only 
going to work on Windows, and only on the R versions you've prepared it 
for.  If the suggested package is only on that platform, I'd suggest 
removing it from "Suggests", and just describe what it does and how to 
use it in a vignette or help page.

If you really want to keep it in Suggests, but don't want to describe 
installation in the way that was recommended to you, then take the other 
route, and put it in an "Additional_repositories" repository as I 
suggested last week -- but this time make sure to use a properly 
formatted repository, not just a web site with some binary builds.  The 
"drat" package makes building one of those really easy.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] "Examples with CPU time > 2.5 times elapsed time" and
 other NOTEs on CRAN and rhub checks
Message-ID: <AS8PR03MB101194981649434A5F83AB8A1D3682@AS8PR03MB10119.eurprd03.prod.outlook.com>

Hi all,
I submitted my package RITCH (https://github.com/DavZim/RITCH) to CRAN (used to be archived but I wanted to revive it again) but I got a NOTE (Question 1 below). Besides this NOTE from CRAN, I got two other NOTEs from rhub (Q2 and Q3).

Q1) The CRAN NOTE (Debian only, does not surface on Windows or other platforms) reads

*checking examples ... [7s/3s] NOTE
Examples with CPU time > 2.5 times elapsed time
                              user system elapsed ratio
read_functions 3.968  0.092   0.831 4.886
(https://github.com/DavZim/RITCH/blob/master/R/read_functions.R in case you need the source code, the full CRAN report can be found here https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/RITCH_0.1.23_20240110_120457/Debian/00check.log)

The package itself has no parallelism built-in, but Imports data.table. This NOTE does not surface on other platforms (eg using rhub or on my GitHub actions runners). My unit tests already limit data.table to 2 cores using setDTthreads(2), but I would like to keep this line out of the help files for my functions.
Is there anything that I can do or can I ignore the result and argue for an exception using the false positive argument?

Q2) A second question that I have is that on rhub Ubuntu Linux 20.04.1 LTS, R-release, GCC (https://artifacts.r-hub.io/RITCH_0.1.22.tar.gz-d2b925faf6b24497abbfa6ff60e51d34/RITCH.Rcheck/00check.log) I receive the NOTE that my libs/ sub-directory is at 7.7Mb. Can I ignore this or do I need to figure out how to reduce the binary size of the package?

* checking installed package size ... NOTE
  installed size is  8.6Mb
  sub-directories of 1Mb or more:
    libs   7.7Mb

My code uses Rcpp and has some classes and interdependencies between C++ functions, therefore a rewrite to make the binary size smaller might take a lot of work. From looking around online I find that other packages are a lot bigger. Are there any low-hanging fruits that I can use to reduce the size or should I ignore this NOTE?

Q3) And last but not least, on some rhub instances (Fedora and Ubuntu GCC) I receive a NOTE that the package runs its examples too slowly (eg above 5secs). I have already tweaked the example code already that it runs reliably <4 secs on my development laptop

Ubuntu Linux 20.04.1 LTS, R-release, GCC (https://builder.r-hub.io/status/original/RITCH_0.1.22.tar.gz-d2b925faf6b24497abbfa6ff60e51d34)
* checking examples ... [6s/37s] NOTE
Examples with CPU (user + system) or elapsed time > 5s
               user system elapsed
read_functions 2.51  0.028   12.57

and on Fedora Linux, R-devel, clang, gfortran (https://builder.r-hub.io/status/original/RITCH_0.1.22.tar.gz-01bf475551eb4b30a722ea79ce421788)

* checking examples ... [6s/26s] NOTE
Examples with CPU (user + system) or elapsed time > 5s
                user system elapsed
read_functions 1.896  0.018   8.891

As this does not surface on the CRAN checks, I would ignore it for now and concentrate only on the CRAN checks. Is this correct or should I pay more attention to these NOTEs?

Any help/comment is appreciated.

Thank you for your time and best regards,
David

A breakpoint on pthread_create confirms that these are OpenMP threads
created by data.table. You can wrap setDTthreads(2) in \dontshow{} to
avoid visual pollution:

I think this is typically accepted for packages using C++.

Then it should be fine.

Additionally, you may need to cast some of your Rprintf arguments to
avoid format warnings on Windows:

Message-ID: <9d76dc3b-9f7b-4883-a866-221e46991e15@stkpp.org>

I'm the mainteneur of the package MixAll.

This package has a dependency to the package rtkore (whom I'm the mainteneur too).
I updated the package rtkore one month ago, fixing a compilation problem on windows devel platform.

MixAll has a dependency to rtkore. Thus, I suspect that the error reported below is due to
the presence of the old version of rtkore on the pretest infrastructure of the CRAN.

My question: is-it possible to know what is the version of rtkore installed on this pretest platform ?
(and the https://win-builder.r-project.org/ site too, as I get the same error on this site).
Il would certainly save me many tries, my suspicion should be true.

Thanks,
Serge

I don't know if you can find out which rtkore version was installed, but 
your package should work with any rtkore version if you haven't declared 
a dependency on a particular version.  So the simplest thing is just to 
declare that you depend on "rtkore (>= x.y.z)" where x.y.z has the 
recent fix.

The "Bad address" here means that /bin/sh got an EFAULT while trying to
launch g++.exe:

Unless there is something extremely weird in the command line arguments
returned by Rscript -e "rtkore:::CxxFlags()" that causes the process to
fail to launch (in my opinion, very unlikely, but can you print them
from your compilation process just in case?), I would be looking for
problems elsewhere.

In particular, the problem cannot be in having rtkore installed that is
one version too old, because you only changed Makevars in that version,
and your package MixAll doesn't use the Makevars from a different
source package.

Hi Ivan,

After somme minor midficiations, I make a try on the winbuilder site.
I was able to build the archive with the static library
but I get again a Bad address error. You can have a look to

https://win-builder.r-project.org/bw47qsMX3HTd/00install.out

Thanks for your help,
Serge

I think that Win-Builder is running out of memory. It took some
experimenting, but I was able to reproduce something like this using
the following:

1. Set the swap file in the Windows settings to minimal recommended
size and disable its automatic growth

2. Write and run a program that does malloc(LARGE_NUMBER); getchar();
so that almost all physical memory is allocated

3. Run gcc -DFOO=`/path/to/Rscript -e 'some script'` & many times

I got a lot of interesting errors, including the "Bad address":

Warnings:
1: .getGeneric(f, , package) : internal error -4 in R_decompress1
2: package "methods" in options("defaultPackages") was not found

0 [main] bash (2892) child_copy: cygheap read copy failed,
0x0..0x800025420, done 0, windows pid 2892, Win32 error 299

0 [main] bash (3256) C:\rtools43\usr\bin\bash.exe: *** fatal error in
forked process - MEM_COMMIT failed, Win32 error 1455

-bash: fork: retry: Resource temporarily unavailable

-bash: R-devel/bin/Rscript.exe: Bad address

Your package is written in C++, but that by itself shouldn't disqualify
it. On my Linux computer, /usr/bin/time R -e
'install.packages("MixAll")' says that the installation takes slightly
less than a gigabyte of memory ("912516maxresident k"), which is par
the course for such packages. (My small Rcpp-using package takes
approximately half a gigabyte by the same metric.)

I'm still not 100% sure (if Win-Builder is running out of memory, why
are you seeing "Bad address" only and not the rest of the carnage?),
but I'm not seeing a problem with your package, either. If EFAULT is
Cygwin's way of saying "I caught a bad pointer in your system call"
(which, I must stress, is happening inside /bin/sh, not your package
or even R at all), it's not impossible that Win-Builder is having
hardware problems. Unfortunately, they take a lot of effort and
downtime to diagnose and could be hiding anywhere from RAM to the power
supply.

The above indeed happens if not sufficient memory would be available.
Important to know: This includes unused but committed memory which may 
be a lot.
But I doubt it is the case on winbuilder as the machines has 256GB or 
more (depending in the machine) and additionally 500GB swap space on SSD.

Uwe

I can take a look, but not sure if I get to it before monday.
I haven't seen it for any other packages recently.

My suspicion is currently a strange mix of cmd.exe and sh.exe calls. But 
this is a very wild guess.

Best,
Uwe

Fascinating, now it worked with the latest winbuilder submission 3 times 
in a row when I checked it manually. So maybe Ivan was right and there 
was a very demanding set of other packages compiling at the same time?
I don't know.

Serge, Can you somply submit your latest winbuilder upload to CRAN?

Best,
Uwe Ligges

Really, I inspected some more. The underlying issue is simple:
The C++ compiler used under Windows asks for precomitted memory. If 
several processes are running at the same time, a lot of memory is 
precomitted. And Windows does not use it for other processes, even if 
almost nothing is actually used.
So while the used memory may be around 50GB, all of the rest (of 756 GB 
including swap space) may have been precomitted (but unused) and new 
processes failed to start correctly. Grrrr.

Best,
Uwe Ligges

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] checking CRAN incoming feasibility
Message-ID: <20240116181522.42573cc6@rolf-Latitude-E7470>


This post essentially amounts to idle curiosity.  I don't really expect
that anything can be done about the problem that I perceive.

When I check a package using --as-cran, the code spits out a line

    checking CRAN incoming feasibility ...

and then disappears into a black hole for what seems an eternity (5 or
10 minutes).

Why does this step take so long?  Surely the software just has to check
that there is web connection to a CRAN mirror.  I would have thought
that this would be executed virtually instantaneously.

cheers,

Rolf Turner

Nope! The full code is in tools:::.check_package_CRAN_incoming  (the
body of which filled up my entire console), but to name a few checks
it has to do: check that the name of the package is not the same as
any other, including archived packages (which means that it has to
download the package metadata), make sure the licence is ok, see if
the version number is ok. 10 minutes is quite a lot though. I suspect
the initial connection may have been faulty.

Well, it may not have been 10 minutes, but it was at least 5.  The
problem is persistent/repeatable.  I don't believe that there is any
faulty connection.

Thanks for the insight.

One of the things done by R CMD check --as-cran at this point is
sending a HEAD request to every Web link mentioned in the package
documentation and DESCRIPTION. One of the hosts may be slow to respond,
either by accident or due to misguided anti-robot countermeasures.
(Most website protection systems would say that R CMD check counts as a
robot because there's no human behind it to look at the ads.)

Here's what you could try. Unpack your built source package. If you
have a fresh .Rcheck directory from an R CMD check, use
YOURPACKAGE.Rcheck/00_pkg_src/YOURPACKAGE. Then profile the check
function, using the subdirectory from the source package archive as the
argument:

Rprof(); tools:::.check_package_CRAN_incoming(dir); Rprof('NULL')

Does any one function stand out in the subsequent summaryRprof()
output? For me, it's readRDS (not very helpful), but by reading
Rprof.out I can see that it's used by CRAN_package_db and
CRAN_archive_db to download web/packages/packages.rds and
src/contrib/Meta/archive.rds from the chosen CRAN mirror, which for me
takes a few seconds for both files.

Do you have a CRAN mirror set up in ~/.Rprofile? It could be having a
slow day.

If I understand correctly, the current procedure is that the client
downloads every package name from CRAN, and then checks its name is
unique. Wouldn?t
it be faster (for both parties) to check name uniqueness directly on the
server?

I'd suggest to choose a local CRAN mirror for the checks (particularly 
as you are located at the most opposite side of the world from Vienna) 
which may help if several requests to CRAN are done.
Also, you may want to disable the URL checks, which also take some time 
for us, but may be way more serious if you point to many URLs that do 
not resolve to servers in your part of the world.

Uwe Ligges

Hey folks! I've received note that a package of mine is failing tests on
oldrel.

Check results:
https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-oldrel-windows-x86_64/arcgisutils-00check.html

I think I've narrowed it down to the way that I've written the test which
uses `as.POSIXct(Sys.Date(), tz = "UTC")`.

If I understand the R release changelog correctly, this behavior did not
exist prior to R 4.3.0.

as.POSIXlt(<Date>) now does apply a tz (time zone) argument, as does
> as.POSIXct(); partly suggested by Roland Fu? on the R-devel mailing list.


https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/NEWS.html

Does this check out? If so, would be more effective to modify the test to
use a the character method of `as.POSIXct()`?

This is not the only check that relies on utils::available.packages().

In particular, strong dependencies are ensured to be present in
mainstream repositories, and the whole strong dependency tree is checked
for packages with FOSS licenses to ensure that their dependencies do not
restrict use.

Additional checks require even more files:

 - src/contrib/PACKAGES.in is checked for CRAN notes on packages
 - src/contrib/Meta/archive.rds is also checked for potential name
   collisions, case-insensitively.
 - src/contrib/Meta/current.rds is checked together with archive.rds
   for update frequency
 - web/packages/packages.rds is checked for maintainer changes

The current scheme, if somewhat wasteful, makes it possible to run R
CMD check with any CRAN mirror without making it run any code server
side. (With the small exception of .htaccess to rewrite some paths, but
that should be translatable for other servers like nginx too.)

It's probably not impossible to transmit only data related to the
current package while keeping this property, but recursive dependency
checks in particular will not be easy. I think it's not worth the
effort.

Seb solved the puzzle (in direct email to me). It has to do with the fact
that _the container_ defaults to UTC.  If I add '-e TZ=America/Chicago' to
the invocation we do indeed see a difference between r-release and r-oldrel
(and I also brought the version string display inside R):

edd at rob:~$ for v in 4.3.2 4.2.2; do docker run --rm -ti -e TZ=America/Chicago r-base:${v} Rscript -e 'cat(format(getRversion()), format(as.POSIXct(Sys.Date(), tz = "UTC")), Sys.getenv("TZ"), "\n")'; done
4.3.2 2024-01-16 America/Chicago 
4.2.2 2024-01-15 18:00:00 America/Chicago 
edd at rob:~$ 

Thanks to Seb for the cluebat wave.

Ralf,

that check always hangs for me (I don't think it likes NZ ;)), so I just use

_R_CHECK_CRAN_INCOMING_REMOTE_=0 R CMD check --as-cran ...

You can also set it in Renviron files consulted just for checks:

  $ grep INCOMING_= ~/.R/check.Renviron*
  /home/edd/.R/check.Renviron:_R_CHECK_CRAN_INCOMING_=FALSE
  /home/edd/.R/check.Renviron-Rdevel:_R_CHECK_CRAN_INCOMING_=TRUE

That's not where it fails - it fails in

today <- Sys.Date()
today_ms <- date_to_ms(today)
as.POSIXct(today_ms / 1000)

which is equivalent to

as.POSIXct(as.numeric(Sys.Date()) * 86400)

and that is only supported since R 4.3.0 - from NEWS:

  as.POSIXct(<numeric>) and as.POSIXlt(.) (without specifying origin) now work.

so you have to add R >= 4.3.0 or use .POSIXct() instead.

I didn't check your other tests so you may have more of the same ...

Cheers,
Simon

Message-ID: <20240117111322.1033ed0b@rolf-Latitude-E7470>


In a package that I am updating, I have a data documentation file
monoCyteSim.Rd.  In this file, two data sets are documented: bivarSim
and ccSim.  The usage section is;

> \usage{
>     bivarSim
>     ccSim
> }

Since the data are lazy-loaded I *don't* wrap the names of the data
sets in "data()".

I do this in another data documentation file (SydColDat.Rd) without
problem. However when I check the package using --as-cran I get a
warning:

> * checking for code/documentation mismatches ... WARNING
> Variables with usage in documentation object 'monoCyteSim' but not in
> code: ?bivarSim? ?ccSim?

No such warning seems to arise in respect of SydColDat.Rd.

Can anyone explain what is going on, and what if anything I can do
about it?  I would be grateful for any insight.

I have attached the two help files, the one that triggers the
warning and the one that doesn't.  I have changed the extension from
.Rd to .txt so that (I hope!) the mailer doesn't strip them away.

The complete package, as it currently stands (if this is of any
interest), is available from my web page:

    https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~rolf/

Scroll to near the bottom and click on "Eglhmm".

Thanks.

cheers,

There is a note on your help page that says

These data are **not** immediately available in the `eglhmm` package.

which seems to be in line with the check warning.

Best wishes,

My package grattan fails the Intel[1] check with

  Error: segfault from C stack overflow

I am unable to immediately see where in the test suite this error has
occurred.  I seek advice on how to fix this error.  The only hunch I
have is that the package uses C code and includes structs with arrays
on the stack, which perhaps are excessive for the Intel check machine,
but am far from confident that's the issue.  The repository is at

Greetings everyone, though I expect this message is mainly for Dirk.

CRAN checks of my bsts/Boom package generate an ASAN error that the CRAN
maintainers have asked me to look into.  I recall doing this before (this
error has been there for several years now) via a docker image that Dirk
had set up.  I have two questions.

1) Which docker image should I use?  I imagine it has been updated since
the last time I tried.
2) Is the image built with an asan-appropriate libc++?  I'm asking because
the last time I tried tracking down this error, ASAN identified that there
was an error, but pointed to an irrelevant section of code.  Brian thinks
libc++ is the culprit.

Thanks -- maybe see prior messages. The container is on a scheduled weekly
rebuild, but for reasons that long escape me I also switched at some point to
relying on the 'sumo' container Winston builds by collating several such
containers and have used this myself for several debugging trips:

You want RDsan and/or RDcsan therein.

Two possibilities to look into:

    * your structures on the stack are large. Don't do this ! Your code 
might run faster and would be easier to debug if you use regular memory 
allocation instead. Since R does fair number of memory allocation calls 
itself, the extra overhead from your calls will not be that noticeable.

    * your stuctures are small, but you have a recursive function that is 
called too often. In this case, the solution is to reimplement the 
recurrence without doing function calls (using a loop, for example). Some 
recurrences can be implemented without using any accumulating state. 
Others need it and you can use heap memory for that.

OK.  Thanks.  Now that you have pointed this out, it's all too obvious.
The user is invited to install the monoCyteSim package (from a specified
github repository).  After the user has done so, then the data sets
bivarSim and ccSim are available in the usual way.

When I ran R CMD check without the --as-cran flag, there was no problem
because I had already installed the monoCyteSim package on my local
computer.  *With* that flag, R CMD check carries on as if it were
looking at the eghlmm package in the context of running on a CRAN
server.  This server would *not* have the monoCyteSim package
installed, whence it would not be able to find the data sets bivarSim
and ccCM, whence the warning.  Makes perfect sense now.

It turns out I can make the warning go away by removing the lines

\usage{
    bivarSim
    ccSim
}

They serve no useful purpose and are not required.

Thanks again.

Speaking as a potential user of such a package, I wonder if that 
information could be put in a help page for the entire package? I've 
seen several packages that do such a "global" overview. I realize there 
might be a Suggests: entry in the DESCRIPTION file but not everyone 
knows how to find it and even those who do might first try for a help 
page if it was in the Index.

Hi All,

We recently encountered an installation issue with our package on CRAN. We've been depending on CMake, assuming it is readily available by default, but it appears to be only available on the M1mac system but not on the others. Should we include the CMake installation within our package?

We encountered another issue with OpenMP, but we managed to resolve it by consulting the manual.

Dear Sameh,

Regarding your question about the MPCR package and the use of CMake
<https://cran-archive.r-project.org/web/checks/2024/2024-01-12_check_results_MPCR.html>:
on a Mac, you have to look for the cmake executable in more than one
place because it is not guaranteed to be on the $PATH. As described in
Writing R Extensions
<https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Using-cmake>, the
following is one way to work around the problem:

if test -z "$CMAKE"; then CMAKE="`which cmake`"; fi
if test -z "$CMAKE"; then
 CMAKE=/Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin/cmake;
fi
if test -f "$CMAKE"; then echo "no ?cmake? command found"; exit 1; fi

Please don't reply to existing threads when starting a new topic on
mailing lists. Your message had a mangled link that went to
urldefense.com instead of cran-archive.r-project.org, letting Amazon
(who host the website) know about every visit to the link:

For package rswipl, cmake still seems to work, but

* one has to search for it on MacOS, see the src/Makevars, as well as the relevant sections in Writing R extensions
* Windows Defender (also on CRAN) complains about dubious exe-files when checking the "endianness" of the target system. That can be circumvented by telling cmake to compile static libraries instead of executables.

I am unsure if my response is specific to your problem, but the links below do not seem to work.

Without testthat, you would have gotten a line by line printout of the code, letting you pinpoint the (top-level) place of the crash. With
testthat, you will need a more verbose reporter that would print tests
as they are executed to find out which test causes the crash.

According to GNU cflow, your only recursive C functions are
getListElement (from getListElement.c) and nthOffset (from Offset.c),
but the recursion seems bounded in both cases.

I've tried looking for variable-length arrays in your code using a
Coccinelle patch, but found none. If you had variable-bounded recursion
or variable-length stack arrays (VLA or alloca()), it would be prudent
to use R_CheckStack() or R_CheckStack2(size_of_VLA), but your C code
contains neither, so there's no obvious culprit. If you know about
R-level recursion happening in your code and have a way to reduce it,
that might help too.

Otherwise, it's time to install Intel Everything and reproduce and
debug the problem the hard way.

You could also try debugging using your toolchain, but with reduced 
stack size (e.g. ulimit -s). If you can make the error appear with a 
smaller but still reasonable stack size, chances are it is due to the 
same underlying problem.

Re Windows, see the documentation:

https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/howto-R-devel.html
https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/howto-R-4.3.html

cmake executable is available. But another issue is how well maintained 
are the cmake configuration files to find the software, etc.

You have most control when you specify the libraries for linking 
explicitly by yourself (and use just make/Makevars files), even though 
this can sometimes require manual changes for newer versions of Rtools 
(some libraries change linking often, most don't). This is the common 
way to do it (see the documentation).

You can also use pkg-config with the latest Rtools, and pkg-config is 
used internally by MXE, which provides some testing, and I've manually 
fixed a number of issues not detected by that testing. The advantage of 
pkg-config is that you don't have to specify the libraries yourself and 
it should reduce the need for updating your Makevars on Rtools updates. 
At the same time, it is much more likely to work than cmake, yet you 
could still easily run to issues, typically some dependency omitted.

I would not use cmake for an R package on Windows.

Indeed, currently Windows Defender gives false positives for some 
temprary .exe files that CMake creates. As thge filenames and locations 
are random, there is no straightforward way to tell the defender about 
exceptions. Hence please follow the advice and  tell cmake to compile 
static libraries instead of executables (an excellent idea, thanks!).

Here's an example. It first checks if CMAKE_C_BYTE_ORDER is defined, which is available in recent versions of cmake. If it isn't, cmake's own macro TestBigEndian is invoked (deprecated, but still available). It would normally compile an executable, but we change the compile target to a static library (the test for endianness works anyway).

if(DEFINED CMAKE_C_BYTE_ORDER)
  if(CMAKE_C_BYTE_ORDER STREQUAL "BIG_ENDIAN")
    set(WORDS_BIGENDIAN 1)
  else()
    set(WORDS_BIGENDIAN 0)

I had a quick look and that package (assuming it's https://github.com/stsds/MPCR) does not adhere to any rules from R-exts (hence the removal from CRAN I presume) so the failure to detect cmake is the least problem. I would strongly recommend reading the  R documentation as cmake is just the wrong tool for the job in this case. R already has a fully working build system which will compile the package using the correct flags and tools - you only need to provide the C++ sources. You cannot generate the package shared object with cmake by definition - you must let R build it. [In rare case dependent static libraries are sometimes built with cmake inside the package if there is no other option and cmake is used upstream, but those are rare and you still have to use R to build the final shared object].

Cheers,
Simon

I think this is the same group that advertised an R package template a
while back that also clearly didn't follow R-exts rules or use any of

Thank you, Ivan and everyone else, for your help. We are working on modifying the package in line with your suggestions.

Regarding the Rcpp template we previously advertised, we are updating it to align better with the rules and constraints of R-exts. If you believe the template is still a potential example, we seek the community?s contribution to making it more tailored for the CRAN and R-exts rules, if not just ignore it.

Again, thanks for helping.


Best,
--Sameh

This post is a continuation of the post *[R-pkg-devel] Does dependencies up to date on the pretest 
CRAN infrastructure*

I made more (unsuccessful) tries:

- I installed a Windows 11 version in a VM on my compuiter and try to buid the MixAll package using 
Rtools42 and Rtools43 (it's quite easy, and funny, to do it on windows: you have just to rename 
C:\rtools42 as C:\rtools43).
The result is that MixAll is build using the 4.2 version and the buid failed using the 4.3 version.

- I installed the version 12.3 of gcc on ubuntu (the same version used on windows) and could build 
the package without problem

- Inspecting the log of the Rtools4.3 
(https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools43/news.html) and g++12..3 
(https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-12/changes.html) does not give insight.

- The package is dependent of the rtkore package which use extensive use of templated class. As 
rtkore is a port for R of stk++, I try to compile the stk++ library on windows (using g++12). All 
tests are compiled without any troubles.

These attempts eliminate some causes, but don't give me any insight why MixAll (and blockcluster) 
failed to be build on the Windows-devel platform. It seems related to Rtools43. Does anyone else 
(using for exemple Rcppeigen) is experiencing this problem ?

There should be no renaming, instead, one should use R 4.2.x with 
Rtools42 and R 4.3.x (or current R-devel) with Rtools43. All of these 
can co-exist (be installed at the same time). Mixing the two could lead 
to different failures. I understand you want to test different versions 
of GCC, but to do that reliable you would have to rebuild the rest of 
Rtools with that, or just the part that is needed by the package.

Please make sure to use Rtools43 (the real one) with R 4.3.

If this is GCC running out of memory on Windows but not Linux, when 
there really should be enough of memory available (i.e. due to the 
problem that Uwe described, maybe the internal GC in GCC is asking for 
too much memory for its heap given that the OS is not overcomiting), you 
can try narrowing it down to a standalone C++ program (independent on R, 
Rtools, R packages, compilable on both Windows and Linux with disabled 
optimizations, etc) that still exhibits the problem and then submitting 
it in a bug report to GCC bugzilla.

In such case, it could be that some heuristics in the collector could be 
improved.

If you have such standalone example, it would be easier to test 
different versions of GCC or even bisect to a concrete GCC version. You 
might also compare memory usage when compiling and cross-compiling.

You might also be able to find a work-around for your package by 
disabling some compiler optimizations. Also if you can narrow this down 
to a concrete GCC optimization then it would help to mention that in the 
bug report.

Certainly all of this would be out of scope of R-(pkg)-devel, this would 
rather be a GCC/Windows thing.

Hi all!



My name is Andriy, and I?m a student at University of Alcal?, currently working on my final year project.



I?m tasked with organizing the R packages developed by our university that are currently available on CRAN. The goal is to enhance their discoverability, to achieve this the initial focus is on exploring the possibility of renaming the packages so that they share a common prefix, making it easier for uses to locate them in the package list.

If you believe there are alternative strategies to achieve a similar result, please feel free to share your perspective.



Additionally, I?m looking into the prospect of merging two packages that contain similar functionalities. The aim is to create a more comprehensive package by incorporation additional features and ensuring seamless compatibility.



Your assistance is key to the successful completion of my final year project, and I would be immensely grateful for any insights you can provide. Thank you for your time and consideration.



Best regards,



Andriy

Hi Andriy

Renaming the packages seems quite drastic. It?ll break existing code and
the packages? dependencies, and any existing name recognition will be lost.
I?m also a bit sceptical that it will greatly affect discoverability: I
don?t think most users find packages by scrolling through the big
alphabetical list.

Here are some less drastic alternatives :

* Post about new versions of the packages to r-pkgs mailing list.
* Write announcements, articles and/or blog posts for rweekly.org.
* if it?s appropriate, suggest the packages for one or more CRAN task
views.
* make sure you?ve got friendly online documentation. The pkgdown package
is pretty good for this, and many people host documentation on GitHub pages.

Best,
David

Hello Andriy and welcome to R-package-devel!

CRAN package names are long-term identifiers. Assume that there are
many users happy with the packages as they are. If you rename a
package, they will have to patch their scripts and their own packages
just to keep them working as before. Red Queen's race is not something
people like to participate in.

It is certainly not impossible to rename a package, but there has to be
a very good reason to break backwards compatibility and assume a new
name, while the old name stays in the archive, unavailable for new
packages.

Here are some past responses to similar questions:

https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-package-devel/2022q2/008140.html
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-package-devel/2017q2/001678.html

There are approximately 20000 active packages on CRAN. Looking for
useful packages by scanning a list of names will not be very effective.
Better results can be achieved using tools like RSiteSearch
<https://search.r-project.org/>. If you want a package to be more
visible, request its addition to a Task View
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/>. If some packages are related,
make them link to each other in their documentation. David's options
are all very good.

The previous point about keeping backwards compatibility still stands.
It should be possible to move all the functions to one package and then
import() it from the other package. Both packages can then export() all
functions, making them available to the dependencies of either package.
Eventually, the skeleton package may grow packageStartupMessage()s
letting the users know that it is deprecated and could they please use
the other package instead. After a while, it should be possible to
archive the skeleton package. But deprecation cycles should be long:
for example, rgeos and rgdal took more than a year to retire
<https://r-spatial.org/r/2022/04/12/evolution.html>.

Or do you intend to come up with a completely new API? Beware of the
second system effect (although it's certainly not unheard of for second
system projects to succeed).

The spatstat package went through the opposite process a few years ago:
it grew too big and had to be split into multiple packages. Here's one
of its maintainers sharing the experience:
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-package-devel/2022q4/008557.html

What is the nature of your final year project? If it can include
technical writing, you could add well-written vignettes to the packages
(only one of the CRAN packages maintained by people @uah.es has a
vignette, and it's very terse). If it has to be mostly programming or
maintenance of R packages, I'm out of ideas.

Either way, good luck, and I hope your project succeeds!

Ivan
