No and no:

1.
       user system elapsed
IOPS 10.06   3.35   35.04

suggests that either the machines this ran on is heavily loaded (so that 
elapsed >> user) or something is waiting like some internet access. [For 
multithreading it would be user > elapsed.]

2. The solution is not to exclude examples ebtirely, as we need runtime 
checks.

For internet access: Set a timeout and let the exampe fail gracefully in 
case web access takes more than, e.g., 2. sec.

In general: Please reduce each example to less than 5 sec.

So use small toy examples. If you really want to add rel world examples 
that may take longer, then add them in addition to toy examples and wrap 
in \donttest{}.

Best,

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] how to use pkgdown::build_site() with a project using
 S7 with a specialized plot()?
Message-ID: <99119974-B153-4584-A974-C4E423D3DB83@dal.ca>

# Question

Is there an online example online of specializing `plot()` for S7 objects, such that `pkgdown::build_site()` will produce webpages?  I ask because I find lots of users (of other packages) tend to consult websites made with pkgdown, rather than using the online help within R.  I think the problem I am having (discussed in the following sections) has to do with my specialization of plot().  I say that because when I was using S3 objects in an earlier version of my package, `pkgdown::build_site()` worked as intended.

# Background

In my 'mooring' package (https://github.com/dankelley/mooring/tree/S7), I am writing code like (https://github.com/dankelley/mooring/blob/f70b53ca12e88968f65710c205b50a64f750a99d/R/plot.R#L69)

```R
#' @aliases plot.mooring
#' ETC
`plot.mooring::mooring` <- plot(ETC) ETC
```

to handle objects made with (https://github.com/dankelley/mooring/blob/f70b53ca12e88968f65710c205b50a64f750a99d/R/oo.R#L2)

```R
mooringS7 <- S7::new_class("mooring",
    package = "mooring",
ETC
```

Built up in Rstudio, with Roxygen2 being used to create documentation, things seem to work, e.g.

```R
m <- mooring(anchor(), wire(length = 80), float(), waterDepth = 100)
plot(m)
```

produces a plot as intended, and

```R
?plot.mooring
```

produces documentation as intended.

*However* I encounter a problem comes when I try building a website with

```R
pkgdown::build_site()
```

This yields results as in the next section.  (I apologize for the length. I'm including the whole thing because I thought that would be less bothersome than writing another email to the list.)

I am not sure how to find the problem, and so I hope that someone on this list can point out an example of how to set up `plot()` to work with S7 objects, in such a way that documentation can be created with Roxygen2 and websites can be made with `pkgdown::build_site()`.

Interesting that the actual error messages seem to be completely
empty.

By chance (I was searching for "rlang See `$stdout` for standard
output" because I was curious to know what is this error message
telling the user to subset) I found a bug report that seems relevant
(as it's also about S7, has the same warning and crashes in the same
call to rlang::check_installed):
https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2186

Unfortunately, there's no solution, just two similar-looking cases.

Is there an equivalent of options(error = recover) for callr child
processes? If you can recover the expression evaluated by the child
process, it could be worth executing it directly and walking the call
stack looking at the local variables at the time of the crash.

Message-ID: <CAL3ufUJs8qG7KOuX3q2T_VPavwsAhNkrvC79pk70KEq_wVZVKQ@mail.gmail.com>

I have a scenario where I have an exported function that requires the
installation a package that *is not* available on CRAN. The body of the
function is generally:

fx <- function() {
  rlang::check_installed("noncranpkg")
  noncranpkg::gx()
}

As required, this package is in the Suggests field. But this results in a
note:

checking package dependencies ... NOTE
Package suggested but not available for checking: ?noncranpkg?

Can this be safely ignored?

Uwe said yes, and he's an authority.  But for your users, it might be 
nice to include an Additional_repositories field so they can find the 
package.  This needs to be organized as an actual repository; the drat 
package is a very convenient way to set one up.

This bug is fixed in the dev version (I don?t remember off the top of my
head in which of pkgdown and roxygen2 you need but it might be both). I?m

Thanks for elaborating, yes of course, people have to declare where to 
get the package from. The note from above is still unavoidable in that case.

Thanks, both. I'm not familiar with Additional_repositories. Must the
package source be specified there? Or can it be specified via documentation
a la Rd file?

 how to use pkgdown::build_site() with a project using
 S7 with a specialized plot()?

Thanks.  I installed the latest roxygen2 and pkgdown, and tried to make a simple reprex
git clone https://github.com/dankelley/mooring.git
cd mooring
git checkout S7
Rscript -e "pkgdown::clean_site()"
Rscript -e "pkgdown::build_site()"

but it still fails.  (Full output is below, for completeness.) I wonder whether I ought to be doing something extra in the Roxygen code (in file R/plot.R within this directory.). Please note that I can rename it as "draw()" or something, but I'm hoping to learn S7 properly, because I'm really quite keen to leave my S3 and S4 days behind me.  (PS to Hadley: I loved the presentation you gave on what was then R7, and have recommended it to colleagues not just for the R7 information, but for the concise explanation of the benefit of OOP and generics.)

This bug is fixed in the dev version (I don?t remember off the top of my head in which of pkgdown and roxygen2 you need but it might be both). I?m planning CRAN updates for both in the near future.

# Question

Is there an online example online of specializing `plot()` for S7 objects, such that `pkgdown::build_site()` will produce webpages?  I ask because I find lots of users (of other packages) tend to consult websites made with pkgdown, rather than using the online help within R.  I think the problem I am having (discussed in the following sections) has to do with my specialization of plot().  I say that because when I was using S3 objects in an earlier version of my package, `pkgdown::build_site()` worked as intended.

# Background

In my 'mooring' package (https://github.com/dankelley/mooring/tree/S7), I am writing code like (https://github.com/dankelley/mooring/blob/f70b53ca12e88968f65710c205b50a64f750a99d/R/plot.R#L69)

```R
#' @aliases plot.mooring
#' ETC
`plot.mooring::mooring` <- plot(ETC) ETC
```

to handle objects made with (https://github.com/dankelley/mooring/blob/f70b53ca12e88968f65710c205b50a64f750a99d/R/oo.R#L2)

```R
mooringS7 <- S7::new_class("mooring",
    package = "mooring",
ETC
```

Built up in Rstudio, with Roxygen2 being used to create documentation, things seem to work, e.g.

```R
m <- mooring(anchor(), wire(length = 80), float(), waterDepth = 100)
plot(m)
```

produces a plot as intended, and

```R
?plot.mooring
```

produces documentation as intended.

*However* I encounter a problem comes when I try building a website with

```R
pkgdown::build_site()
```

This yields results as in the next section.  (I apologize for the length. I'm including the whole thing because I thought that would be less bothersome than writing another email to the list.)

I am not sure how to find the problem, and so I hope that someone on this list can point out an example of how to set up `plot()` to work with S7 objects, in such a way that documentation can be created with Roxygen2 and websites can be made with `pkgdown::build_site()`.

 From the CRAN polcies:

"Packages on which a CRAN package depends should be available from a 
mainstream repository: if any mentioned in ?Suggests? or ?Enhances? 
fields are not from such a repository, where to obtain them at a 
repository should be specified in an ?Additional_repositories? field of 
the DESCRIPTION file (as a comma-separated list of repository URLs) or 
for other means of access, described in the ?Description? field. "

Best,
Uwe Ligges

Did you re-document? You?ll need that to correctly regenerate the .Rd, I
think. (Sorry I?m on vacation so I?m guessing at stuff from my phone)

Oh, Hadley, I'm sorry to bother you whilst you're on vacation.  Please don't take too much time on.  I'm certainly not in a rush at all.

To answer your question, yes, I rebuilt the documentation (within RStudio, via the 'More/Document' scheme) and it still fails.

I wonder if I need to do a

method(plot, mooring:::mooringS7) <- function(ETC) {ETC}

instead of

`plot.mooring::mooring` <- function(ETC) {ETC}

which is what I'm doing now, and which works for plotting but not webpage-building.

PS. That `mooringS7` vs `mooring` name difference is because I am using

mooringS7 <- S7::new_class("mooring", ETC

because I want the user-facing function to be called `mooring`.  (I am having the user using the object constructor directly.  I guess I could, but I'm doing it this way to retain my old code, which used S3 methodology and had a fair bit of logic before constructing a return value.  I can change that, of course.  For now, my S7 steps are a bit timid, so I can fall back to my S3 code if I cannot figure things out.)

Did you re-document? You?ll need that to correctly regenerate the .Rd, I think. (Sorry I?m on vacation so I?m guessing at stuff from my phone)

This bug is fixed in the dev version (I don?t remember off the top of my head in which of pkgdown and roxygen2 you need but it might be both). I?m planning CRAN updates for both in the near future.

# Question

Is there an online example online of specializing `plot()` for S7 objects, such that `pkgdown::build_site()` will produce webpages?  I ask because I find lots of users (of other packages) tend to consult websites made with pkgdown, rather than using the online help within R.  I think the problem I am having (discussed in the following sections) has to do with my specialization of plot().  I say that because when I was using S3 objects in an earlier version of my package, `pkgdown::build_site()` worked as intended.

# Background

In my 'mooring' package (https://github.com/dankelley/mooring/tree/S7), I am writing code like (https://github.com/dankelley/mooring/blob/f70b53ca12e88968f65710c205b50a64f750a99d/R/plot.R#L69)

```R
#' @aliases plot.mooring
#' ETC
`plot.mooring::mooring` <- plot(ETC) ETC
```

to handle objects made with (https://github.com/dankelley/mooring/blob/f70b53ca12e88968f65710c205b50a64f750a99d/R/oo.R#L2)

```R
mooringS7 <- S7::new_class("mooring",
    package = "mooring",
ETC
```

Built up in Rstudio, with Roxygen2 being used to create documentation, things seem to work, e.g.

```R
m <- mooring(anchor(), wire(length = 80), float(), waterDepth = 100)
plot(m)
```

produces a plot as intended, and

```R
?plot.mooring
```

produces documentation as intended.

*However* I encounter a problem comes when I try building a website with

```R
pkgdown::build_site()
```

This yields results as in the next section.  (I apologize for the length. I'm including the whole thing because I thought that would be less bothersome than writing another email to the list.)

I am not sure how to find the problem, and so I hope that someone on this list can point out an example of how to set up `plot()` to work with S7 objects, in such a way that documentation can be created with Roxygen2 and websites can be made with `pkgdown::build_site()`.

Answering my own question here ...

The problem was that I was using

	mooringS7 <- S7::new_class("mooring", ETC

instead of

	mooringS7 <- S7::new_class("mooringS7", ETC

With the change to the latter, all works fine now.  Thanks very much to all who have helped, so generously and so quickly.  

I wish a very Happy New Year, to all!!

I ask because I find lots of users (of other packages) tend to consult websites made with pkgdown, rather than using the online help within R.  I think the problem I am having (discussed in the following sections) has to do with my specialization of plot().  I say that because when I was using S3 objects in an earlier version of my package, `pkgdown::build_site()` worked as intended.

I understand that perfectly, but for instance my package declared already
has over 800 tests and 100% code coverage. More unit testing in the
vignettes really strikes as unnecessary.

One other reason to use a static vignette, in my case, is that package
Sweave is not available for my version of R (on MacOS, M2 version)

Yes indeed, I know about R.rsp.
To me at least, zero dependency means that users install that package and
that package alone, the reason for which I am now looking for static
(preferably html) vignettes.

I guess another question is why should the "Suggests" packages need to be
installed by end users. I understand CRAN checks need to make sure the
Vignettes can be processed and the code inside runs fine (just like the
examples in the Rd files) but it is very unlikely that end-users will want
to compile the vignettes themselves.

From my own experience of almost 20 years of using R, I never-ever build
the vignettes of a certain package because it is much simpler to read them
on CRAN. I wonder, then, why are end users forced to install
Vignette-building "Suggests" packages (with long dependency chains) when
they practically never do that.

Life would be much simpler if the Suggests packages would not be
(automatically) installed, or if CRAN provided a way to include static
Vignettes to avoid the heavy dependencies of building them.

Best regards,
Adrian

As far as I know, there is no package called Sweave, there's just the 
Sweave() function in the utils package.>

Users aren't forced to install "Suggests" packages.  That's a choice 
they make.  The default for `install.packages()` is `dependencies = NA`, 
which says to install hard dependencies (Imports, Depends, LinkingTo).
Users have to choose a non-default setting to include Suggests.

Also note that the maintainer builds the vignette whe calling
R CMD build
CRAN checks whether the vignette can be build.
If a user installs a package, the already produced vignette (on the 
maintainers machine by R CMD build) is instaled. There is no need for 
the user to install any extra package for being able to look at the 
vignettes.

Best,

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Assigning an object to the global environment (shiny
 package)
Message-ID: <CAMyz+tW8yVq5GEDG31aQmL39QCUeAXyVH1=Nhb5baEWyCq8pqg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone!
I which a happy new year!


I'm coding a shiny app and I would like to include an option so that the
users can assign the results to the global environment for further analysis.

I have written the following code, which checks if 'globalvarname' (the
name of object to be created in the global environment) already exists,
returning an error if so, and asking to the user change the name.

code
-----------
observeEvent(input$savetoglobalenv, {
 ### more code here

  if (exists(input$globalvarname, envir = globalenv())) {
    sendSweetAlert(
      session = session,
      title = "Error",
      text = paste0("The object'", input$globalvarname, "' already exists
in the global environment. Please, change the name."),
      type = "success"
    )
  } else {
    assign(input$globalvarname, report, envir = globalenv())
    ask_confirmation(
      inputId = "myconfirmation",
      type = "warning",
      title = "Close the App?",
      text = paste0("The object'", input$globalvarname, "' has been created
in the Global environment. To access the created object, you need first to
stop the App. Do you really want to close the app now?"),
      btn_labels = c("Nope", "Yep"),
      btn_colors = c("#FE642E", "#04B404")
    )
  }
})
---------

Thus, the object is only created when the user decides to assign such an
object to the global environment. As the object's name is checked, there is
no way of replacing some object already available in the global environment.

Of course, when running devtools::check(), a NOTE is returned

Found the following assignments to the global environment:
  Arquivo 'plimanshiny/R/mod_analyze.R':

Can I ignore this safely?
Is there any suggestion to handly this without using 'assign()'

Thanks in advance,
Olivoto

You cannot and should not ignore this.

An R package should never ever be assigning variables into environments for
which they haven't been granted permission to do so. You should ask the
user whether they want the object assigned in the global environment before
doing so, and the default should be no so that it will not be assigned in
non interactive sessions.

A simple alternative would be to assign it into a private environment 
managed by your app, and supply a function to the user to retrieve it 
from there.  The user can choose where to assign the result of that 
function.

So instead of:

   user says to save to "myvar"
   you save to myvar
   user uses myvar

you would have

   user says to save value
   you save it privately
   user runs myvar <- savedvalue()

If your app requires users to be able to save several different values, 
the user could enter a name on the first line and enter it again on the 
third line.

I understand that this doesn't actually *solve *your problem, but would
like to offer an alternative perspective.

I often find that vignettes may be most useful as an extended form of
documentation. If you have a pkgdown site, you can use
`usethis::use_article()` to create an article which will not be included as
part of the package itself but will be served in the documentation site of
the package. I don't think many people consume extended package
documentation through vignettes all that much but often prefer to rely on
the package website. Using the article format means that your package tests
on CRAN will not be subjected to any other packages used in the articles or
vignettes.

Cheers!

Alternatively, you can create a new environment in your package and assign
into it and fetch out of it. This is definitely safer and probably "more
idiomatic." Hope that helps!


# create a new environment

I see... then I must have tested with dependencies = TRUE thinking this
refers to hard dependencies (one more reason to read the documentation
properly).

Thank you,

Good day

I think I finally have a final package that only yields the expected 'New
submission' note.
The package is available at:
https://github.com/WoutersResearchGroup/R-IO-PS/tree/CRAN-prep.

Is there a way to confirm that this package is ready for submission?
I submitted it to https://win-builder.r-project.org/ and
https://mac.r-project.org/macbuilder/submit.html and
https://builder.r-hub.io/. All of these seem to only show the expected new
submission note.

I see the CRAN package submission web form is unavailable until the 8th, so
any confirmation that my package should be fine for submission would be
appreciated.

Thank you
Christiaan

Congratulations! I also get the single expected NOTE in my checks.

This may be your last chance to rename the package from iopspackage to,
say, "IOPS". If you go over the package and the CRAN policy at
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html> one last time
and deem the package compliant, it should be ready for submission.

The CRAN reviewer may find additional problems and ask you to fix them,
but you are likely most of the way there.

Apologies for the double e-mail, but I've read the code now, and
wrapping the example of your only function in \dontrun{} will most
likely not be allowed.

Is it really the case that you cannot remove a single row from the
example dataset without making the example crash? It may help to write
a function that would remove rows one by one, make sure that the
example still runs, and keep doing that until not a single row can be
removed. The complexity is terrible (something like O(n^k)), but let it
run for a while, and maybe it'll reduce the dataset enough to fit in
the example time limit.

I may add two cents on that as we recently made this change in data.table.
Using markdown package instead of rmarkdown as a vignette engine reduced
burden caused by extra dependencies tremendously. Moreover it made package
to not even need c++ compiler, as knitr and markdown both (and their
recursive deps) are pure C with no C++.
Gains were huge. Deps installation time from 12min to 30sec. CI pipeline
compute minutes saving around 100min on a single workflow.

But there is even a better news (so be sure to upvote), that knitr may not
be required to render Rmd at all in near future. For details see

Good day

I have edited my package to have two examples. One uses a small
self-generated dataset and another uses a big dataset. For the big dataset
example, I put \donttest{} around it, should this be fine?

I only get one note for the new package, available at
https://github.com/WoutersResearchGroup/R-IO-PS/tree/CRAN-prep.

Kind regards
Christiaan

The small example is definitely fine: it exercises the code and does so
fast.

The big example wrapped in \donttest{} could be fine, I'm not sure.
I've seen CRAN packages that wrap the long parts of their examples in
\donttest{} while still making sure that R CMD check --run-donttest
exercises most of their code.
