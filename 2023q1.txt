Hello, All:


	  What are current recommendations for GitHub Action?


	  My most recent change to "sos" generated "Failed to get R" for 
ubuntu-latest (release, devel, and oldrel-1).


https://github.com/sbgraves237/sos/actions/runs/3820307473/jobs/6498527786


	  I would happily rtfm if I only knew which fmtr.


	  Thanks,

This warning says to update to v2 of the action from r-lib:

We ran into a similar problem and switching to v2 did the trick.

As the error is common against your _all three_ of your Ubuntu runs, you
could consider the possibility that the events are correlated.  Most often it
simply means a (temporary, usually) network or server outage.  I would wait,
and then relaunch (which these days you can do just for the failed jobs).

It is also worth paying attention to warnings such as

   Warning: r-lib/actions/setup-r at v1 is deprecated. Please update your
   workflow to use the 'v2' version. Also look at the examples at
   https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v2/examples because '@v2' workflows
   are much simpler than 'v1' workflows.

Hth,  Dirk

	  Thanks to Zhian Kamvar and Dirk Eddelbuettel for encouraging me to 
look at the warning.


	  I replaced a few lined of my "R-CMD-check.yaml" file with the the 
"v3" and "v2" versions in the example in 
"https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v2/examples" and deleted 
subsequent lines that I didn't understand, and I got an instant failure: 
  It didn't run even one of the 5 tests.  Then I did "git revert" with 
the version number from GitHub and changed several lines to match the 
example with the succeeding yaml code.  GitHub Action ran and failed on 
all 5 platforms.  I did "git revert" with that and changed 
"r-lib/actions/setup-r at v1" to "r-lib/actions/setup-r at v2".  With that, 
R-release ran successfully on Unbuntu as well as Windows and macOS.


	  However, Ubuntu failed with devel and oldrel1, complaining, "there is 
no package called ?rcmdcheck?".


	  See:

	  Suggestions?
	  Thanks,
	  Spencer Graves

If we start from the error message and work backwards, it's easy to see
that `rcmdcheck` fails to install because it depends on `curl`, which
also fails to install. `curl` fails to install because the virtual
machine running the GitHub Action doesn't have libcurl headers
installed; there's even an error message about that, but it's not fatal:

------------------------- ANTICONF ERROR ---------------------------
Configuration failed because libcurl was not found. Try installing:
 * deb: libcurl4-openssl-dev (Debian, Ubuntu, etc)
 * rpm: libcurl-devel (Fedora, CentOS, RHEL)
If libcurl is already installed, check that 'pkg-config' is in your
PATH and PKG_CONFIG_PATH contains a libcurl.pc file. If pkg-config
is unavailable you can set INCLUDE_DIR and LIB_DIR manually via:
R CMD INSTALL --configure-vars='INCLUDE_DIR=... LIB_DIR=...'
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't have enough experience in the abstraction layers involved, but
if you stuff a `sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev` (which should
run as a system command line, just like the "Install system
dependencies" step) somewhere before the "Install dependencies" step,
it should work.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] S3 generic/method consistency false positive when
 dplyr imported
Message-ID: <CAGPRvNDXHT-ZB4H6if_RRRwSFahUFDWbuKeppFBihvVQ4DodWA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm modifying a package so as to remove its dependence on the superseded
packages *reshape2* and *plyr*, in favor of dependence on *dplyr*.  In
particular, I'm just importing the one function `dplyr::bind_rows`.

A curious thing happens, however, as soon as I include this among the
imports.  I begin to get R CMD check NOTEs alerting me to the presence of
S3 generic inconsistencies.  These are associated with two functions in the
package: `filter.mean` and `filter.traj`, which the checker mistakes for S3
methods based on the generic `stats::filter` function.  Actually, these are
not S3 methods.  In fact, they are S4 generics and declared as such.

When *dplyr* is not imported, R CMD check is happy with these functions.
When it is imported, R CMD check complains.

Now I understand that it may be preferable to move away from functions with
names containing dots for this reason, and in fact I am already doing so,
but I think the question is a good one:

Why does inclusion of *dplyr* in the import list appear to trigger these
warnings when they were not there before?

Thanks in advance for any insight you can give!

I think that's because dplyr itself contains an S3 generic named
"filter", and having a package namespace loaded (not even attached) is
enough to take its registered S3 methods into consideration for method
dispatch. Here we have an opposite situation, though, and your
functions aren't registered as S3 methods. Will your function still be
called if you artificially construct a wrong object and feed it to
dplyr::filter while your package namespace is attached?

library(YOURPACKAGE)
dplyr::filter(structure(list(), class = 'traj'))

Additionally, stats::filter doesn't seem to be an S3 generic, so that's
one thing that the check gets confused about.
