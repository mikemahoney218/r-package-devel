Hello, All:


	  What are current recommendations for GitHub Action?


	  My most recent change to "sos" generated "Failed to get R" for

We ran into a similar problem and switching to v2 did the trick.

As the error is common against your _all three_ of your Ubuntu runs, you
could consider the possibility that the events are correlated.  Most often it
simply means a (temporary, usually) network or server outage.  I would wait,
and then relaunch (which these days you can do just for the failed jobs).

It is also worth paying attention to warnings such as

   Warning: r-lib/actions/setup-r at v1 is deprecated. Please update your

	  Thanks to Zhian Kamvar and Dirk Eddelbuettel for encouraging me to 
look at the warning.


	  I replaced a few lined of my "R-CMD-check.yaml" file with the the 
"v3" and "v2" versions in the example in 
"https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v2/examples" and deleted 
subsequent lines that I didn't understand, and I got an instant failure: 
  It didn't run even one of the 5 tests.  Then I did "git revert" with 
the version number from GitHub and changed several lines to match the 
example with the succeeding yaml code.  GitHub Action ran and failed on 
all 5 platforms.  I did "git revert" with that and changed 
"r-lib/actions/setup-r at v1" to "r-lib/actions/setup-r at v2".  With that, 
R-release ran successfully on Unbuntu as well as Windows and macOS.


	  However, Ubuntu failed with devel and oldrel1, complaining, "there is 
no package called ?rcmdcheck?".

If we start from the error message and work backwards, it's easy to see
that `rcmdcheck` fails to install because it depends on `curl`, which
also fails to install. `curl` fails to install because the virtual
machine running the GitHub Action doesn't have libcurl headers
installed; there's even an error message about that, but it's not fatal:

------------------------- ANTICONF ERROR ---------------------------
Configuration failed because libcurl was not found. Try installing:
 * deb: libcurl4-openssl-dev (Debian, Ubuntu, etc)
 * rpm: libcurl-devel (Fedora, CentOS, RHEL)
If libcurl is already installed, check that 'pkg-config' is in your
PATH and PKG_CONFIG_PATH contains a libcurl.pc file. If pkg-config
is unavailable you can set INCLUDE_DIR and LIB_DIR manually via:
R CMD INSTALL --configure-vars='INCLUDE_DIR=... LIB_DIR=...'
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't have enough experience in the abstraction layers involved, but
if you stuff a `sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev` (which should
run as a system command line, just like the "Install system
dependencies" step) somewhere before the "Install dependencies" step,
it should work.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] S3 generic/method consistency false positive when
 dplyr imported
Message-ID: <CAGPRvNDXHT-ZB4H6if_RRRwSFahUFDWbuKeppFBihvVQ4DodWA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm modifying a package so as to remove its dependence on the superseded
packages *reshape2* and *plyr*, in favor of dependence on *dplyr*.  In
particular, I'm just importing the one function `dplyr::bind_rows`.

A curious thing happens, however, as soon as I include this among the
imports.  I begin to get R CMD check NOTEs alerting me to the presence of
S3 generic inconsistencies.  These are associated with two functions in the
package: `filter.mean` and `filter.traj`, which the checker mistakes for S3
methods based on the generic `stats::filter` function.  Actually, these are
not S3 methods.  In fact, they are S4 generics and declared as such.

When *dplyr* is not imported, R CMD check is happy with these functions.
When it is imported, R CMD check complains.

Now I understand that it may be preferable to move away from functions with
names containing dots for this reason, and in fact I am already doing so,
but I think the question is a good one:

Why does inclusion of *dplyr* in the import list appear to trigger these
warnings when they were not there before?

Thanks in advance for any insight you can give!

I think that's because dplyr itself contains an S3 generic named
"filter", and having a package namespace loaded (not even attached) is
enough to take its registered S3 methods into consideration for method
dispatch. Here we have an opposite situation, though, and your
functions aren't registered as S3 methods. Will your function still be
called if you artificially construct a wrong object and feed it to
dplyr::filter while your package namespace is attached?

library(YOURPACKAGE)
dplyr::filter(structure(list(), class = 'traj'))

Additionally, stats::filter doesn't seem to be an S3 generic, so that's
one thing that the check gets confused about.

Thanks for the fast reply!

When I follow your suggestion above, I get

library(pomp)
dplyr::filter(structure(list(), class = 'traj'))

Error in UseMethod("filter") :
  no applicable method for 'filter' applied to an object of class "traj"

Which is not what would happen if my filter.traj function were called.  So
the S3 dispatch system is not confused.  Thus this really is a false
positive.

It still leaves open the question, why does this suddenly appear when dplyr
is loaded?  If I understand you correctly, it would be triggered by the
inclusion of the generic 'filter' in dplyr, which was previously not
present. However, since the S3 dispatch system is not itself confused, I
suppose it must be the case that the S3 generic/method consistency checker
itself is confused.  I wonder, how does the checker decide when to throw a
NOTE?  Is it a simple pattern-matching system, something like "If X.Y is
exported, where X is a generic and Y is any string and X.Y is not declared
as an S3 method, then throw NOTE"?

The aim of the check is a bit different: "if an S3 method for generic X
and class Y exists, and the formal arguments of X.Y don't extend the
formal arguments of X in a certain way, then throw a NOTE", but then
something gets wrong about deciding whether X.Y is an S3 method, and
once filter.mean is decided to be an S3 method, of course it doesn't
match the formals of filter.

This function is even a public API of the tools package, see
?tools::checkS3methods:
https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/blob/b57918fd104962415a752ea7db12dcf4f3f5219f/src/library/tools/R/QC.R#L2310-L2560

Interesting. I wonder if there's are other remaining ways to confuse
the S3 dispatch system into thinking your function is an S3 method that
the check is supposed to guard against. For instance, the following is
likely to work with your package:

library(pomp)
library(dplyr)
identical(filter.traj, getS3method('filter', 'traj'))
# as long as there's a visible 'filter' generic, getS3method will
# locate filter.traj as the method

...despite the method lookup seems to (correctly) fail, as you've just
demonstrated. But on older versions of R, this used to wrongly resolve
the call:

library(Ropj)
read <- function(x, ...) UseMethod('read')
identical(read.opj, getS3method('read','opj')) # works in R-devel
# [1] TRUE
read(structure(0, class = 'opj')) # calls read.opj in old R
# Error in read_opj(file, encoding, tree) :
#   Expecting a single string value: [type=double; extent=1].

I'm afraid I'm out of my depth here. The old, wrong behaviour seems to
match the R language definition
<https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.html#Definition>.
The current behaviour seems to do the right thing? by letting the
functions opt into being methods, but then getS3method() seems to
contradict what actually gets called. Should we be fixing the
documentation, the implementation, or the check?

Can you try stepping through tools::checkS3methods('pomp') (or
tools::checkS3methods(dir = 'path/to/source/directory')) to see where
'filter' appears in the list of generics and where the

Excellent suggestion, Ivan. Thanks for pointing out just where to look.

I stepped through tools::checkS3methods("pomp") and it does appear to be
roughly as I conjectured.  Namely, all functions are extracted from the
pomp namespace and checked against a list of generics.  The check that is
performed is a simple pattern-match (i.e.,
startsWith(paste0(genericname,"."), functionname)).  Clearly this is prone
to false positives.  I wonder what would be involved in tightening this up
so that it agrees with what the actual dispatch mechanism gives....

Interestingly, there is a whitelist, implemented mostly via
tools::nonS3methods().  The function (plyr::rbind.fill) that I had been
importing is there but its replacement (dplyr::bind_rows) is not. So this
answers my original question.

The whitelist appears to be a somewhat arbitrary compilation of functions
from various packages, with no obvious theme.  For example, dplyr is not on
the list, but ElectoGraph is; reshape is on the list but reshape2 is not.
The impression of arbitrariness is reinforced by the fact that packages
that Wickham has for whatever reason decided are superseded are present in
that list and packages he considers for the moment to be worth maintaining
are not.  Doing a quick 'git blame' I see that the whitelist was mostly put
together in 2013, with a few additions in 2015 and much more occasionally
since.

It occurs to me that there ought to be a mechanism whereby a package author
could add to the list of non-S3 methods.  I see from the mailing list
archives that there was discussion of this back in 2015 (
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2015-June/071356.html), with what
looked like consensus that there ought to be such a facility, but nothing
seems to have actually been done about it.  I conjecture that the decision
was to just fold false positives into the whitelist on an ad hoc basis.

Version 2.0.0 of my ?evclass' package was rejected for the second time with the following note from the Debian check (the Windows check is OK):

* checking package subdirectories ... NOTE
Problems with news in ?NEWS?:
  Cannot process chunk/lines:
    Version 2.0.0 includes an implementation of radial basis function neural network classifiers, as well as functions to express the outputs of trained logistic regression or feed-forward neural network classifiers as Dempster-Shafer mass functions. These methods are based on an interpretation of the operations performed in neural networks as the combination of weights of evidence by Dempster's rule (see: "T. Denoeux, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks and Dempster-Shafer Theory: a New Perspective. Knowledge-Based Systems 176:54-67, 2019").

I already tried to change the NEWS file but I have no idea where the error might come from. The NEWS file is a text file created by TextEdit on Mac with UTF-8 encoding, so I don?t see how there could be hidden special characters in it. I see nothing special in the line that could not be processed. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Best,

Thierry

The problem is that the NEWS files are supposed to have a certain
format (documented in help(news)). For a long time, this hasn't been
enforced, but now there are checks in place that require NEWS to be
written to specifications.

I think that your line can be transformed as follows in order to parse
correctly:

Changes in version 2.0.0

 * Implementation of radial basis function neural network classifiers,
   as well as functions to express the outputs of trained logistic
   regression or feed-forward neural network classifiers as
   Dempster-Shafer mass functions. These methods are based on an
   interpretation of the operations performed in neural networks as the
   combination of weights of evidence by Dempster's rule (see: "T.
   Denoeux, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks and Dempster-Shafer
   Theory: a New Perspective. Knowledge-Based Systems 176:54-67, 2019").

You can also write an inst/NEWS.Rd file in Rd format.

As you can see from reading ?news, it is preferred to provide a
bulleted list of the changes.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Mysterious "invalid z limit"
Message-ID: <c9f10ae8-a82a-c3c0-bac8-1e9b4948366f@gmail.com>

Hi,

I am in the middle of developing a new package, which contains a 
markdown-knitr-html vignette. When I try to run

R CMD build [mypackagedirectory]

I get an error message

Quitting from lines 330-336
Error: processing vignette? failed with diagnostics:
invalid z limits

If I run the same markdown script interactively inside R Studio, there 
is no error.
If I knit the markdown script inside R Studio, it produces the correct 
HTML output, with no error.

The offending lines of code (the chunk at 330-336) invoke an "image" 
method on an object of a class defined in the package, which in turn 
computes a matrix from items inside the object and calls image.default, 
which is presumably where the error is coming from.

Two questions: (1) How is it possible that the same code works error 
free in the RStudio contexts, but fails in the attempt to build the package?
(2) Any suggestions on how to debug something that only throws an error 
from "R CMD build" would be most welcome.

Thanks in advance,
 ? Kevin

Debugging that sort of thing is hard.  Here's what I would try:

 From inside an R session, run

   tools:::.build_packages("[mypackagedirectory]")

That runs the code that R CMD build runs, so it might trigger the same 
error.  If so, debug in the usual way, with traceback(), etc.

If that doesn't trigger the error, try it using a different front-end, 
e.g. running R at the command line instead of running it in RStudio.

If you still can't trigger it, then start modifying the vignette to find 
the exact line that causes the error (e.g. by commenting out the second 
half of the code in that chunk; did the error go away? etc.).  Then 
modify it again to save all the inputs to the bad line in a file before 
running it, and see if running that line in a different context still 
triggers the error. Etc.

A frequent cause of such errors is that in the offending scenario a method is not visible, so the call goes directly to the default method. This often can be verified by temporarily printing something from your method when it gets control.

Without more details it is difficult to be more specific. It may be a missing import or export, for example.

When knitting the vignette from RStudio, it uses the package you
already have installed. When knitting the vignette from R CMD build, it
uses the code it's about to package. Could it be that your source code
is different from the copy installed in your library?

R CMD build --no-build-vignettes should let you proceed and get a
tarball that could be installed. Hopefully you'll be able to reproduce
the error then.

A terrific answer; thanks. (I am kicking myself for not realizing the 
answer you gave to question 1. Of course that's the explanation. Too 
many consecutive hours debugging other items to get to that point, I 
suppose.)

A very helpful answer. For some reason (probably because I have an 
ancient perl script that automates the steps i take when building and 
checking packages), I keep forgetting that the "tools" package let's me 
do these things from within R.

I had already isolated the offending line ("plot(obj)") inside the chunk 
where the error occurred, and removed any additional arguments. I 
wrapped that line in a "try" command followed by a conditional 
"traceback()" to find the problem.? This allowed the package build to 
knit the vignette and provide some feedback about what was going on. It 
turned out that I had copied and pasted an assignment line of the form

main <- [compute the title]

from earlier in the code and pasted it directly as an argument to the 
call to image.default. And R did exactly what I told it to (not 
surprisingly), and interpreted the value of that assignment as the 
unnamed "zlim" option that would have been the corresponding positional 
argument that should have been there.

And yes, I still use "left arrow" <- instead of equals = as assignments. 
(Heck, I even use emacs and ESS with a leftover keybinding that uses the 
underscore key to insert the left arrow. Apparently, I'm ancient myself.)

	  If you use GitHub, I highly recommend using "GitHub Action" as 
described by Wickham and Bryan, R Packages:


https://r-pkgs.org/code.html#code-style


	  I'm not sure the best way to get it set up, but I have all my 
packages on GitHub configured so each "push" that changes anything has 
"R CMD Check" run on 5 different platforms:  The release version of R on 
the latest Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu plus the development version and 
the most recent old release on Ubuntu.  I rarely run R CMD check on my 
local machine anymore:  I just "git commit" and "git push".  Then GitHub 
Action manages testing on those 5 platforms.


	  To be precise, I do "git status" before "git push" to make sure I 
have "committed" everything I want to commit before I "git push".  And I 
do "git pull" to make sure a collaborator hasn't "pushed" something new 
I should look at before I "git push".


	  Finally, I want to thank again G?bor Cs?rdi who helped me greatly get 
past problems I hand with "GitHub Action" for my "sos" package.  He 
provided example workflows in:


https://github.com/r-lib/actions/blob/v2-branch/examples/check-standard.yaml


	  I also needed LaTeX support, for which G?bor suggested the following:

I have been using R-Forge for many years for package development. And I
have been using GitLab for other projects almost as long.

However, over the past few months, the R-Forge support seems to be
decaying, and I now have several projects that won't currently build there
because of various items that appear to need fixing at their end. So, I am
actively exploring what it will take to move packages and projects to git.

I already know how to use a git client to clone a Subversion repository
from R-Forge (using "git svn"). And how to change the remote origin to push
it to a new git location. (And I  may also be willing to lose the revision
history if it is going to make the transition easier.)

I am now at the step of understanding the recent changes at GitLab with
respect to support for "Educational" or "Open Source" status, especially in
terms of how many monthly minutes of CI/CD time I can use for free. When
working on a new package, I tend to make lots of small commit-pushes, and
it sounds like each one of those will eat up minutes. So, any advice on how
to manage that issue would be greatly appreciated.

Best,
  Kevin

	  R-Forge was wonderful for me when I started using it.  Then several 
years ago, I started having problems like you described.  A few years 
ago I migrated from R-Forge to GitHub.


	  One problem I encountered in the transition:  On R-Forge, I had 
multiple packages in the same R-Forge project.  I had to split them 
apart for GitHub.

	  When I first got into Subversion, I remember Doug Bates saying, 
"Commit early and often."  The word "Commit" doesn't mean the same in 
Git as in Subversion, so I would encourage you to "Git push early and 
often."


	  There may be limits on free use of GitHub, but I'm not aware of them: 
  If you want a private account, you need to pay for that, but the 
charges for that are not much.


	  If anyone knows anything different from what I've just said, I hope 
they will disabuse my of this part of my ignorance.

   The free tier of Github allows 2000 minutes/month of continuous 
integration testing for private repos, and unlimited (???) for public 
repos.  (2000 minutes/month is more than I've ever needed.)

   Furthermore, it's pretty easy to set up github actions so that it 
only runs tests if you ask it to (by appending e.g. "[run ci]" to your 
commit message), or in opt-out mode (i.e., skip tests if "[skip ci]" is 
in your commit message).

Thanks for mentioning the possibility to opt out of the CMD checks on GitHub actions, which I didn't know about before. I also have GHA set up and I like the concept of automated testing, but one thing that bothers me is that sometimes I make a small but necessary commit (e.g. to fix a bug) and it runs the whole suite of tests and checks on all functions which takes around five minutes. Most of the time this is overkill and it occurs to me that it has an unnecessary environmental impact. Perhaps this is something to think about occasionally in our CI/CD setups.

So now I'm off to tweak my GitHub actions...

Did you have to split the packages to get the CI/CD tools to work? 
Because,to me, it looks as though I can install multiple different R 
packages from the same git project, using something like

library(devtools)
install_gitlab("krcoombes/[PROJECT]", "pkg/[PACKAGE]")

Best,
 ? Kevin

Dear list members,

I am getting the following response when I try to upload growthPheno_2.1.17.tar.gz:

Detected package information [non-editable]
In case of errors reupload the package or contact cran team

The package was successfully uploaded on 2022-11-15. It is available on https://github.com/briencj/growthPheno.

I have scoured the DESCRIPTION file and compared it with the DESCRIPTION file for dae, another of my packages that has been successfully uploaded in the last 12 hours.

I have run R CMD  --as-cran growthPheno_2.1.17.tar.gz with the final status being OK.

I am stumped as to what is causing the problem. Can anyone throw any lot on what the problem might be?

Thanks in advance,

Cheers,

 Chris

That's not an error. This message is to inform you that the following
fields have been extracted from your DESCRIPTION file and aren't
supposed to be edited by hand. Is there a better way to phrase that?

Do you see anything out of place in the form? If the form content seems
OK, click the "Submit package" button near the bottom of the page to
continue.

Hi Ivan,

Thanks for taking up my query.

I realized after I sent the message that I should have added that the package files is being dropped as well. It replaces my file name with "No file chosen".  Consequently I cannot continue submit the package.

I saw it as an error message because it is not a message that I have seen in the many times that I have uploaded a package to CRAN.

My interpretation of the message was that there is some "non-editable" material in the package information, most likely the DESCRIPTION file.

However, I doubted that this could be the case because the only changes in the DESCRIPTION file since I uploaded Version 2.1.16 two months ago are in the Version, Date, Packaged and Suggests, the latter having writeXLS removed because it is no longer needed.  I have verified that these are the only changed by extracting the DESCRIPTION file from both growthPheno_2.1.16 and 2.1.17 and doing a file comparison on them.

This led me to think that the problem must be in other than the DESCRIPTION file.

Unfortunately, I remain unable to upload the package.

Cheers,

  Chris

I understand that this behaviour is counter-intuitive, but that seems
to be the way it's supposed to work. Package submission is a multi-step
process:

Step 1 involves providing your name, your e-mail address and the
package file. Once uploaded, the package file stays somewhere at CRAN,
at least for a while.

Step 2 involves making sure that you've uploaded the right package.
You're shown your name, e-mail address, the optional comment and the
fields from the DESCRIPTION file. The "Package:" file upload field
should be empty because CRAN already has a copy of the file.

Pressing the "Re-upload the package/Edit information" will repeat the
step 1 and take you back to the same place, just before the step 2. In
order to progress, you need to press the "Submit package" button below
the form, despite the "Package:" file upload field is empty.

Do the "Title:", "Description:", "Authors(s):" fields contain the
information for your package? Does the "Submit package" button work for
you? Are there any other messages there?

Perhaps the CRAN submission form should show some indication that the
file has been uploaded near the file entry field during step 2?

Hi Ivan,

The submit button has worked!!!!

You are right that it is counterintuitive and I have been well trained not to submit things to CRAN that contain errors :-)

I agree that something like "Package uploaded" would be better than "No file chosen" in Stage 2, afterall I have chosen a file.

Thanks very much for your help. All's well that ends well.

Cheers,

  Chris

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Rcmd check skip example
Message-ID: <CAJGy0hd219xgqs0_gfiu_gQRNfZHcq+u7Qx1+hXV9iNQE2TjJA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

In the process of adding examples to the .RD file, I noticed
Rcmd check seems to skip certain example code.

I put my example code  x%*%y%*%z  (matrix multiplication) in the
RD file. After running Rcmd check
(on windows) and look into the xxx.Rcheck directory,
  xxx-EX.ROUT  file, it seems that the example check stopped
 at x (i.e. everything after % sign is ignored, like LaTeX).

That seems like a bug. Can anyone confirm on newer version?

Mine:

else)

Rd documentation is latex like, so comments can be included with a percent
symbol. You should write \% if you intend to write a literal percent
symbol.

R 4.1.0 was released before Windows 11, but even in R-devel, 
sessionInfo() reports "Windows 10" on "Windows 11". The problem is that 
the information comes from win.version()/GetVersionEx() and, as also 
documented in ?win.version, this may return "compatibility version".

With the already released versions of R and current R-devel, one can 
tell Windows 11 from the build number (your 22621 is Windows 11 22H2, 
22000 is Windows 11 21H2).

Thanks for spotting and reporting this.

Indeed, the versions from 10.0.22000 are called Windows 11.
Windows 10 builds are expected to stay below 10.0.22000.
It is up to Microsoft why the label their version 10.x.y as Windows 11 
(well, they labelled version 5.x.y as Windows 2000 etc., so nothing new 
here).

Message-ID: <992486ed-6a0c-4b12-f306-1a18cb573d4e@effectivedefense.org>

Hello, All:


	  The NAMESPACE file in


https://github.com/JamesRamsay5/fda


is corrupted.  RStudio 2022.12.0+353 (the current version) won't open 
it, complaining, "File is binary rather than text so cannot be opened by 
the source editor."  TextEdit (macOS 11.7.2) opened it as normal, as did 
vi.  Both allowed me to make and save changes, but RStudio still gave 
the same error.  Worse, after "git push", GitHub Action on 5 platforms 
ended with:


** byte-compile and prepare package for lazy loading
Error in parse(nsFile, keep.source = FALSE, srcfile = NULL) :
   1:1: unexpected input


	  That's the same error I've gotten with "R CMD build fda" locally.


	  Suggestions?
	  Thanks,
	  Spencer Graves

Your NAMESPACE file starts with a U+FEFF ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE.
You'll need to remove it, e.g. by re-creating the first line.

Note that this is also called "byte order mark" (BOM). Tell your editor 
not to create files with BOM.

You can also fix in R:

x <- readLines(..., encoding="UTF-8-BOM")
writeLines(x, ......)

	  In RStudio 2022.12.0+353 (the current version),


tools::showNonASCIIfile('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JamesRamsay5/fda/master/NAMESPACE')


returned "char(0)".  'readLines' and 'writeLines' as Uwe suggested 
failed to fix it for me.


	  The first problem I noticed with this was that RStudio could not read 
the NAMESPACE file.  When I tried, it said, "File is binary rather than 
text so cannot be opened by the source editor."  I changed something 
using a different editor and did "git commit" and "git push", and got 
the error on GitHub that I reported above.  I copied the file elsewhere, 
deleted it locally and from GitHub, then recreated it in LibreOffice by 
manually typing the first and last lines then copying the rest from a 
copy I had saved elsewhere.  The RStudio would open the file, but I 
still get the same error message as above from both "R CMD build fda" 
locally and from GitHub Action at:


https://github.com/JamesRamsay5/fda


	  Other suggestions?

I think Uwe's suggestion was to check out the file, apply his two steps, 
and commit it again.  Your showNonASCIIfile() call was trying to work on 
something else.  Maybe your other commands were too?

Another possibility is to roll back all your changes to that file until 
you have a copy you can work with.  I think commit ab455089 is probably 
the bad one; Github shows invisible changes to the first line.  You 
don't want those.

Setting the locale to "C" (or perhaps some other non-UTF-8 locale) will
show the BOM bytes.  E.g., on Windows I get:

> Sys.getlocale()
[1] "LC_COLLATE=English_United States.utf8;LC_CTYPE=English_United

xFEFF isn't a BOM in a UTF-8 file, its not anything.   The UTF-8 BOM is a
different sequence of bits.  If tools treat it as a BOM, that is arguably a
problem.

You're right.  FEFF is the UTF-16 big endian BOM.  UTF-16 is a 16 bit 
encoding, not at all the same as UTF-8.  I don't know how to read UTF-16 
in R. Uwe's advice was for UTF-8.

Hello, All:


	  My attempts to fix this problem exposed what seems to be a completely 
unrelated problem:  All five GitHub Actions end now with:


Error: package or namespace load failed for ?fda? in namespaceExport(ns, 
exports):
  undefined exports: refinery


	  The package includes ~man/refinery.Rd, ~data/refinery.rda, and 
NAMESPACE includes "export( ... refinery, ...)".


	  ???
	  I have Bitdefender installed on this computer.  A "Quick Scan" 
produced nothing just now.


	  Thanks,
	  Spencer

I think if you declare something as data by putting it in the data 
directory and using LazyData:true, you shouldn't also declare it as an 
export in the NAMESPACE file.

	  I got the same negative results after deleting "LazyData: true" from 
DESCRIPTION.  (That's what I would expect, because there are 17 other 
*.rda files in the data subdirectory that are are mentioned in NAMESPACE 
and are not creating a problem.  In 2009 the package included both 
"data/refinery.rda" and "man/refinery.Rd".  They were erroneously 
removed at some point.  I'm now trying to restore them.)

So you have declared LazyData: true?
How does the other package access the data object? By imprt directives?
Perhaps you exported the data in the past via the NAMSPACE file? But 
then it has to be in sysdata.rda?



Sorry for the confusion with the BOM.
The encoding sting for UTF-16  with byte order mark is "UTF-16BE".
I'd believe much more should have gone wrong then. Perhaps it was some 
editor that really messed it up?

Uwe Ligges

Message-ID: <CAFDswJvzbtDy8v0xdNZd+KOH-r_4hUFQupuHxbLTScobw2vmpg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

In my recent re-submission with a bug-fix of the hdf5r package, I got a new
set of warnings from the compiler, one being that I shouldn't be using
'sprintf'.

Is there a simple replacement that I can use?

Thanks

You should use snprintf() which has an extra argument to state the size 
of the buffer receiving the string.  For example,

  char text[32];
  sprintf(text, "%.4g", value);

could be written as

  char text[32];
  snprintf(text, 32, "%.4g", value);

This will write a string with at most 31 characters before the NUL at 
the end, and avoids the possibility of a buffer overrun.

Hi,

thanks for the tip! Is that available everywhere or do I need to set
compiler requirements?

You shouldn't need any special requirements.  I think this was 
standardized in C99, which is supported by default in R.  Not sure which 
C++ version adopted it, but it's available there too.

I just cloned the repository, and saw the same error as you saw.  Then I 
followed my advice, and removed `refinery` from the NAMESPACE file, and 
the error went away.

Since you don't have `LazyData: true` in the current version, you need 
to run `data(refinery)` to make that dataset available.  That does work.

I also tried restoring `LazyData:true` as well as removing `refinery` 
from NAMESPACE, and that works too, without the need to call 
`data(refinery)`.  The variable is just available.

I'm not sure which *.rda files you are talking about that "are mentioned 
in NAMESPACE".  Now that I've removed `refinery` in my copy, I don't see 
any of them.

Even Microsoft added snprintf to Visual C++ in 2015 (not that that matters
for R).

And even better idiom (which I only came to too late for the update of a few
of my packages) is to rely on sizeof() as in

    char text[32];
    snprintf(text, sizeof(text), "%.4g", value);

which works for many / most simple cases of such static buffers.

Sometimes this sprintf compiler 'noise' is shrapnel from other packages we
include as headers, and harder to fix.  Brian Ripley kindly alerted us to one
remaining instance in the Rcpp headers which we fixed in October; the updated
package is currently awaiting its fate during its bi-annual update cycle but
is held in the dark and deep bowels of CRAN awaiting inspection (nine days
and counting now) as is package BH which in its annual update got a number of
headers refreshed from its upstream, plus an extra round of polish from
me. It too is available as an update in its git repo, and otherwise hiding in
those dark CRAN bowels.  I keep telling myself I should remain hopeful that
maybe one day we get to take advantage of it. Hopefully soon.

 Dear all,

I try to submit a new version of the package phangorn and got the mail back:

"Dear maintainer,

I am kind of puzzled as to what the problem is, but it might well be that I
missed something? I appreciate any suggestions.

   Seems pretty mysterious to me! (No cryptic NOTEs anywhere in the 
logs, other than the inevitable "Note_to_CRAN_maintainers")

   I will be curious to see if anyone else finds something, but my guess 
is a hiccup on the CRAN end (i.e., you'll end up sending e-mail to the 
CRAN maintainers to clarify what's going on)

Is this the whole e-mail? There may be a list of problems at the end of
the message, right after the signature ("Best regards, CRAN teams'
auto-check service"). It may be about the time your vignette took to
build on Windows, but I'm not sure about that.

Please reduce the vignette build timings by using
  - small toy data only

Otherwise we cannot afford checking the vignette regularly on CRAN.

Hello all,

I am submitting a minor update to one of my CRAN package (BIGL), and get strange errors on R-devel on win-builder - https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/BIGL_1.6.7_20230119_225109/Windows/00check.log and https://win-builder.r-project.org/o339zPAR6pWG/00check.log (different symbols)

It shows strange output like "`1Y???hA?..." before tests and cryptic error-messages like "unable to translate '(<be><b1><a7>m' to a wide string"
I can also see similar output in examples - https://win-builder.r-project.org/o339zPAR6pWG/examples_and_tests/BIGL-Ex.Rout 

I don't get any isses on debian R-devel, on R-release on windows, and also can't reproduce the errors locally on a windows machine with R-devel, so I am a bit lost.
Would anyone have any idea of what goes wrong?

Kind regards,
Maxim Nazarov

These are errors and warnings in regex operations (grep, gsub) due to 
that the input data is not a valid string (validly encoded string). 
Because it is not valid, it cannot be converted to a wide string, which 
is needed for the regex operation, as this uses TRE.

So, you need to find out why the input strings are invalid. Common 
causes of such problems are that they are in a different encoding from 
the one told to R or to some other software on the way. Also the data 
may be corrupted.

It should be fairly easy from the error output to find out which 
operations have failed in the vignette. Perhaps you could find out how 
their inputs were generated.

If you have a Windows machine with R running in UTF-8 as the native 
encoding, with recent R-devel, and the error is still not reproducible, 
try to confirm that the inputs for the failing operations are correct.

Thank you, Tomas, for your insights!

I think I found the root cause of the problem - my package uses the `nlsLM` function from the `minpack.lm` package and coincidentally the new version of that package was submitted to CRAN recently.
Looking at https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/minpack.lm_1.2-3_20230117_110122/reverseDependencies/changes.txt - we can see that this new version of minpack.lm is causing similar errors in many of its reverse dependencies.

In fact if I install that version from https://cran.r-project.org/incoming/archive/ I get the strange output when running a simple example from `nlsLM` even on linux:
```
install.packages("https://cran.r-project.org/incoming/archive/minpack.lm_1.2-3.tar.gz")
library(minpack.lm)
DNase1 <- subset(DNase, Run == 1)
capture.output(fm1DNase1 <- nlsLM(density ~ SSlogis(log(conc), Asym, xmid, scal), DNase1))
## produces "\xa8\002\x8c\003\x9bU"
```
this seems to come from the C code, which I don't fully understand.

So I guess it is an unfortunate timing, and I just need to wait for the minpack.lm package to be fixed, but I'm wondering (philosophically) if it is correct that my package is checked against non-released (non-approved) version of minpack.lm and rejected because of its shortcomings?

Kind regards,
Maxim Nazarov

These are errors and warnings in regex operations (grep, gsub) due to 
that the input data is not a valid string (validly encoded string). 
Because it is not valid, it cannot be converted to a wide string, which 
is needed for the regex operation, as this uses TRE.

So, you need to find out why the input strings are invalid. Common 
causes of such problems are that they are in a different encoding from 
the one told to R or to some other software on the way. Also the data 
may be corrupted.

It should be fairly easy from the error output to find out which 
operations have failed in the vignette. Perhaps you could find out how 
their inputs were generated.

If you have a Windows machine with R running in UTF-8 as the native 
encoding, with recent R-devel, and the error is still not reproducible, 
try to confirm that the inputs for the failing operations are correct.

I think that is likely bad luck, in that your package was being 
evaluated at the same time as the new minpack.lm, and CRAN/winbuilder 
don't isolate the builds.  If you resubmit unchanged (I'd do this on 
winbuilder, not CRAN) you may get a more reasonable outcome.

I'm 99% sure this comes from the following changes to the package:

--- minpack.lm_1.2-2/src/fcn_message.c  2020-03-23 10:54:03.000000000 +0300
+++ minpack.lm_1.2-3/src/fcn_message.c  2023-01-17 09:30:05.000000000 +0300
@@ -3,24 +3,24 @@
 char *fcn_message(char *msg, int info, int n, int nit)
 {
     if      (info == 1)
-        sprintf(msg, "Relative error in the sum of squares is at most `ftol'.");
+        Rprintf(msg, "Relative error in the sum of squares is at most `ftol'.");
     else if (info == 2)

(And so on for other values of `info`.)

sprintf() takes a string pointer to write into as its first argument.
Rprintf(), on the other hand, prints straight to the R console; its
first argument is the format string. Given a valid pointer to an
uninitialised string instead of the format string, Rprintf prints stack
garbage to the console, ignoring the following arguments. My guess is
that the maintainers either intended to remove the msg argument
altogether or needed to use snprintf() and pass the buffer size to
fcn_message().

 If you had to choose one binary to preserve for a pkg, which would it be?
Message-ID: <em688ae61e-9014-4e28-9c9b-7af67631a44a@6e5c1f4b.com>

This is not a perfect list for this question, but possibly a good list.

I maintain 'groundhog', a package that seeks to simplify reproducibility 
of R code based on R packages.
It has so far relied on MRAN  for binaries of older/archived versions of 
packages, but MRAN is shutting down.
Posit (R Studio) also has archived binaries, but they are less 
transparent about it,  they do not have Mac binaries, and I am a little 
uncomfortable relying on a 3rd party again, specially because their 
archive is more difficult to navigate and this is part of a for-profit 
venture so access is far from guaranteed. So...

I will create an independent archive of all binaries for packages for 
Windows and Mac machines.

Instead of having daily backups like MRAN does/did, i will keep just one 
binary per combination of package, version, R version, operating system.
So a single 'rio' 0.5.0 binary for Windows for R-4.2.x, for example 
(MRAN keeps a daily copy of such file instead, possibly with 100+ 
identical or nearly identical copies).

I need to decide whether to keep the first binary that was uploaded to 
CRAN, the last one, or one in the middle, etc.
In  concept binaries should work regardless of which file is chosen, but 
there is a reason, i guess they are rebuilt so often so it may make a 
difference in the margin which of the many builts available in MRAN is 
chosen to be preserved. I think it has to do with changes in underlying 
packages used to build them, but am not sure.
This decision will also guide future archiving, which of the many 
versions of to be uploaded to CRAN binaries are preserved.

So, if you have experience or knowledge on this, which of the many 
previously created binaries for a given package version would you choose 
to archive long-term?
Groundhog will always attempt to install from source if a binary fails, 
so a certain error rate is tolerable.

Message-ID: <PH0PR06MB71575B163CB7557D3E0E146AEDC89@PH0PR06MB7157.namprd06.prod.outlook.com>

Dear all,

Hope you are well! Recently, in the check before a re-submission, I got an unexpected note when doing R CMD Check using rhub::check_for_cran(), saying that "Examples with CPU (user + system) or elapsed time > 5s".

I didn't expect this note to appear because the same examples didn't cause this note in the previous submission last December. Compared with the previous submission, we only edited documentation, there was no change in the R code for functions of our package.

To double-check, I downloaded our previous submission from CRAN and checked it again. It's strange that this current CRAN version also has this note now. However, when submitting it last December, there were no such notes. Do you have any idea why the R CMD Check results are inconsistent?

Since the examples caused no note in the last submission and were successfully submitted to CRAN, I'm not sure whether I should change the examples in this re-submission to eliminate this sudden note. Any suggestions will be appreciated!

Thank you!
Ying

Package maintainers recently got a message telling us not to use 
sprintf() any more.  I guess the minpack.lm maintainer either didn't 
read the whole message carefully enough and used Rprintf as a substitute 
instead of snprintf(), or intended to use snprintf(), but typed 
Rprintf() out of habit.

I think the date-based snapshots made sense, that corresponded to how 
packages were tested and built together. I am afraid you cannot get 
close to that by choosing a single version. If you really must use only 
one, probably the latest.

If I wanted some reasonably reliable repeatability of computations, I 
would though keep a virtual machine snapshot with the matching OS, 
matching version of R, the packages installed (probably from source in 
case debugging became needed), and all external dependencies. Ideally 
with disconnected network to make sure the computation works fully 
locally, and as I would not be updating the OS, for security as well. I 
would keep that snapshot intact - never save the machine state again to 
it. And if possible convert it to several image formats just in case the 
virtualization software stops being supported or no longer can read 
certain formats.

Uri,

I can speak only for macOS package binaries and they have been rarely re-built. The only time when a re-build is necessary is when a dependency is updated and breaks its backward-compatibility (sadly, yes, that happens). It is relatively rare, but recently Matrix was one example with reasonably big fall-out. Those things are likely to happen more often in the future, but if you are mainly interested in an archive then you should be able to simply go by modification dates for the macOS binaries. However, I would add a black-out period after a major R release, because what happens is that I do a full re-build of all packages after a major R release (up til then the packages are build against the beta/RC) and that can take up to a few days, so I wouldn't keep packages built before that first set is done which can be few days after the release.

Cheers,
Simon

You could check on Winbuilder as that is a concrete setup used for 
incoming checks. But in principle, the computation may take longer 
because of changes in dependencies, external software and R. Which can 
be due to a performance regression, a bugfix, etc. Only 
debugging/profiling could reveal the true cause.

If you were close to the limit last time, it may be a coincidence and 
you might simply reduce the examples to be on the safe side.

Yes, it may even be some OS update, or just coincidence that the system 
was idling the last time your package got checked.
Note that CRAN systems are expected to be slower than, e.g., your 
laptop, as the servers use multi core CPUs with rather low frequencies.

Thank you, Duncan and Ivan for helpful feedback.
I reached out to the maintainer of the package, and she was able to quickly resolve the issue and resubmit.
Consequently my re-submission was accepted.

Kind regards,
Maxim Nazarov

Package maintainers recently got a message telling us not to use 
sprintf() any more.  I guess the minpack.lm maintainer either didn't 
read the whole message carefully enough and used Rprintf as a substitute 
instead of snprintf(), or intended to use snprintf(), but typed 
Rprintf() out of habit.

 If you had to choose one binary to preserve for a pkg, which would it be?

Hi list,

I received a few emails, some off list, and replied privately to all.  
Based on the feedback, I decided to modify the approach to replacing 
MRAN.
To those interested, the updated plan follows:

1) Mac and Windows binaries from MRAN will be saved in a new archive, 
which will be called "GRAN" (G is for groundhog).  GRAN will also 
continue collecting new binaries from CRAN and archiving them for the 
foreseeable future.

2) In general, a given package, version, OS file will be saved once in 
the archive, using the 1st file posted to CRAN for that 
package-version-os (but looking at CRAN at least 10 days after a major R 
release, to ensure it was built with the released R version). There are 
two exceptions to this single binary rule (see (3) and (4))

3) The top 2% of packages on CRAN, with the most reverse dependencies, 
will be saved every 1st of the month even if it is the same package 
version. This mitigates the consequences of a given already built  
binary becoming incompatible with other packages (for example the binary 
for MASS is saved again, every 1st of the month, even if the version has 
not changed)

4) When a Mac binary is rebuilt, since they are are seldom rebuilt, it 
will be assumed that something happened, and that package version binary 
will be saved again for all OS. For example, if on 2021/05/03 MASS was 
rebuilt for Mac, the version for Windows and arm mac will also be saved 
again. Just in case. This is essentially piggybacking on Simon Urbanek's 
decisions to rebuild binaries, it assumes they are often diagnostic of 
needing a new build.

5) The package groundhog will automatically select the relevant binary 
to install, based on this architecture. Users will continue to simply 
need to run:
groundhog.library(pkg, date)

6) Once everything is rolled out and running smoothly, i will explore 
adding ubuntu binaries to GRAN

This should generate a fairly robust, if necessarily imperfect , archive 
of binaries, with a manageable GB footprint (ballpark <3TB  for all 
packages since 2014), and maximal ease-of-use.

The selective copying of MRAN-->GRAN is  taking place now, the version 
of groundhog that benefits from it should be released around May, 
several weeks before Microsoft erases MRAN.

Thanks for your feedback so far, very happy to receive further 
suggestions or thoughts off list.

Best,

Uri

The only time when a re-build is necessary is when a dependency is updated and breaks its backward-compatibility (sadly, yes, that happens). It is relatively rare, but recently Matrix was one example with reasonably big fall-out. Those things are likely to happen more often in the future, but if you are mainly interested in an archive then you should be able to simply go by modification dates for the macOS binaries. However, I would add a black-out period after a major R release, because what happens is that I do a full re-build of all packages after a major R release (up til then the packages are build against the beta/RC) and that can take up to a few days, so I wouldn't keep packages built before that first set is done which can be few days after the release.

Greetings!

I submitted my USA.state.boundaries package on 6 January 2023 and Uwe 
responded back letting me know that it was over the 5 MB CRAN threshold. 
I responded back to Uwe letting him know that as of that date there were 
52 CRAN packages over 5 MB. As of today (29 January 2023), there are 
actually 53 CRAN packages over 5 MB.

As I heard no response back from Uwe, I re-submitted my 
USA.state.boundaries package on 12 January and 21 January. As of today, 
I have not heard any response back from Uwe or any other CRAN team 
volunteer.

There are 2 questions:

1) How long should it take to receive a response back from a CRAN team 
volunteer after a manual inspection of a CRAN package?

2) Why has my package been denied acceptance to CRAN while a new package 
over 5 MB has been allowed to be hosted on CRAN recently?

Thank you in advance.

   Out of curiosity, what was the recently added package?

   It looks like the previous version of your package from about a year 
ago is only a 1.2MB tarball.  Also out of curiosity, what caused the 
increase?

   cheers

My understanding is that packages over 5MB are only allowed under
exceptional circumstances. You would need to include a note in your
submission explaining why it is over 5 MB. If it is not accepted, then the
reason provided is not sufficient. I believe that the CRAN guidelines
actually state this, and there may even be Stack Exchange cases related to
this, as well.

Not sure about how long to wait for a response, but since the CRAN team is
made up of volunteers who have plenty of other things on their plates, I
always interpret a lack of response as meaning that I missed something
obvious.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Proper way to express Fortran 2008 dependence for R
 package
Message-ID: <CAL6gwnL+7q5wKkittHkO4GEq=ri5thUBEEjjY_q=C9nwOrnEeQ@mail.gmail.com>

I would like to convert some of my hand-rolled Fortran code to Fortran
intrinsics which entered the language in Fortran 2008, which should be
extremely widely supported at this time. Specifically, I would like to
use the log_gamma function and ieee_arithmetic functions and values.
If it helps, the current package is at [1] and devel branch with new
code is at [2].

If I understand it correctly, WRE allows for dependence on Fortran
2008 by explicitly passing -std=f2008 in PKG_FFLAGS (WRE section 1.2.3
Using F9x code [3]). However, checking a package as-cran with that
addition delivers a warning (further confirmed by win-builder and
rhub).

My question is is it appropriate to submit a package with that warning
and note it in the submission or is there a better way to express
reliance on Fortran 2008. The implication from WRE 1.2.4 is that
passing standards in Makevars is preferable to stating them in
DESCRIPTION, at least as regards C++.

What somewhat complicates matters is that if I build my package
(Rtools43 on Windows 10) without passing "-std=f2008" it still builds
properly and passes all the tests because Rtools43 is based on GCC12.2
which supports Fortran 2008 intrinsics. So I can probably submit it
without the flag, but someone with a very old Fortran installation may
suffer.

I understand being told I should just address CRAN directly, but I
thought I would try the collected institutional memory here first.

Thank you,

Avi

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Help with CRAN-only Windows-only package build error:
 System.Rd not found
Message-ID: <CAEbuDvJuzUn7JKdWeH6u8MtvETcMi4m3tvmZXtvQ3bSB8xGHpA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all, trying to troubleshoot my way through my first CRAN package
submission. I've addressed all the other issues so far (much thanks to Uwe
from CRAN for that).

In the second-to-last version I submitted via devtools::release(), it
raised 1 WARNING on both Windows and Debian:
* checking sizes of PDF files under 'inst/doc' ... WARNING
  'gs+qpdf' made some significant size reductions:
     compacted 'noise.pdf' from 1.4Mb to 1.1Mb

To address this, I re-released to CRAN with vignette compaction active:
devtools::release(args = "--compact-vignettes=gs+qpdf")

However, this now raises 1 new NOTE (only on Windows) and 1 ERROR. The NOTE
is:
* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... [7s] NOTE
Reading Rd files failed with
  cannot open the connection
Problems when formatting CITATION entries:
  cannot open file 'D:/RCompile/recent/R/share/Rd/macros/system.Rd': No
such file or directory

Which later produces the ERROR:
* checking whether package 'gcplyr' can be installed ... ERROR
Installation failed.
See 'd:/RCompile/CRANincoming/R-devel/gcplyr.Rcheck/00install.out' for
details.

If I check 00install.out, here's what I see:
* installing *source* package 'gcplyr' ...
** using staged installation

Execution halted
ERROR: lazy loading failed for package 'gcplyr'
* removing 'd:/RCompile/CRANincoming/R-devel/lib/gcplyr'
* restoring previous 'd:/RCompile/CRANincoming/R-devel/lib/gcplyr'

There were no changes to the code between two submissions, and when I
googled around to try to figure out what might be causing this error, I
couldn't find anything that would explain why a submission that was
successful other than a single too-large vignette pdf now raises an error
when the pdf's are compacted before submission.

The full package source code is available at
https://github.com/mikeblazanin/gcplyr.

Let me know if you have any ideas what could be causing this or what to
look into! This isn't an issue I've been able to reproduce on my local
machine nor on the rhub checker so it's a bit difficult for me to debug and
I don't want to take up any more of the CRAN volunteers' time

Thanks!

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Best current way to hook into the event loop?
Message-ID: <3e315cd1-d4fb-8bff-f801-7fad9eddbac5@gmail.com>

I'm updating low level stuff in the rgl package.  I'm exploring using 
the GLFW library to handle low level stuff instead of trying to do that 
myself.

Currently rgl has fairly ugly code to link into the R event loop.  (It 
needs to do this so that it hears about mouse movement, etc.)  I'm 
hoping that someone else has written better code than I could to do 
this.  Is there a currently recommended way to hook into the loop?

The kinds of things I need are getting events fairly frequently (e.g. 
0.03 second delay if things aren't too busy) for code that doesn't 
involve R at all.

I will also occasionally want to call back into R; I don't really mind 
if there's a bigger delay to wait for that to be safe.

I've seen the "later" package:  it looks as though it might do what I 
need, but the protection for R code seems to be all or nothing, i.e. if 
I want to evaluate an R expression nothing else can be running, or if I 
want action while R code is running, I can't involve R at all.

Duncan,

I don't know if it is best, but you can have a look at "background"[1] which is I believe what "later" was inspired by. It is a very minimal example so should give you ideas on how to do that in your package - it runs the R code on the main thread so it should be as close to safe as one can get with asynchronous calls, just beware of reentrance. In your case I suspect that you may already have an X11 fd that you can use in the unix handler - not sure what signaling you need on Windows, though.

Cheers,
Simon

Thanks.  Yours appears to have the advantage of being able to run R code 
in the middle of a function call if that function calls R_ProcessEvents, 
as Sys.sleep() does.  I wonder why "later" didn't support that?

What I was hoping for would be something like R_PolledEvents, but it 
should work on all systems, not just Unix-alikes.  My goal is to 
simplify rgl.  Part of this means I'd like to minimize the system 
dependence, since I no longer have easy access to a Windows machine for 
testing.

Message-ID: <CALECgPYrOi1dcS_LfyuW5A+DQqjmC5SxepVof0Q64oWbFdt_Lw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear List -

What?s the latest best practice on trying to reproduce warnings raised
on CRAN checks?

I updated my epanet2toolkit package earlier this week.
R CMD check ?as-cran was clean on RHUB and Winbuilder and my local
machines.  But on CRAN a few variations are causing warnings.

For example R-devel-debian-gcc is ok on rhub
https://builder.r-hub.io/status/epanet2toolkit_0.6.1.tar.gz-58c1ce1e316317307679f58450a5e17a

But
not on CRAN:
https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-gcc/epanet2toolkit-00check.html

Thanks in advance for any suggestions.

Brad

Message-ID: <BL0PR06MB4371458D1DC48087B8F6E780C6D79@BL0PR06MB4371.namprd06.prod.outlook.com>

Dear R-package-devel,

I am updating package mvmesh that is on CRAN.  I would like to split that package into two parts, mvmesh (multivariate meshes/grids) and mvhist (multivariate histograms). Does CRAN have a policy/practice on this?   I did  a search, but found nothing on this.

I would do this in two steps:

  1.  Extract some of the functions in the current package into a new package.   Submit that package as mvhist and wait for approval.
  2.  Remove the extracted functions from the current package, and submit it with a new version number.
There is a short term problem that some functions would exist in two places during the time period it takes to do step 2.  After that, users who want to use the functions in mvhist will have install both packages.

I don't want to add work for the CRAN team, so please let me know if this is forbidden or there is a better way.

Thanks,  John

I think your plan is good, though it is missing one step that should 
happen between 1 and 2:

Contact maintainers of all packages that use mvmesh and tell them what 
changes they need to make.  According to the CRAN page for mvmesh, 
that's just two packages, both of which you maintain:  gensphere, 
SphericalCubature, but you may know of others (e.g. on Bioconductor or 
elsewhere) who should be informed.

If those are the only two, then the step should be to send any necessary 
updates to them before proceeding to step 2.  When you do get to step 2, 
mention what steps you took to inform mvmesh users.

You will get these warnings if you do things like
    char *string = (char*)malloc(length);
    snprintf(string, sizeof(string), "format ...");
sizeof(string) here is 8 (on a 64 bit machine), no matter what length is.

Change this to either
   char string[64] // 64 had better be big enough
   snprintf(string, sizeof(string), "format ..");
or
   char *string = (char*)malloc(length);
   snprintf(string, length, "format ...");

 Proper way to express Fortran 2008 dependence for R package

For closure, I was advised by Professor Ripley to both pass
"-std=f008" in Makevars and add "SystemRequirements: A version of
gfortran supporting Fortran 2008" to the DESCRIPTION. CRAN accepted
the package with those two changes. I also note that the R Daily News
of 2023-02-03 [1] has the following entry under "R-devel": ?check?'s
?checking compilation flags in Makevars? has been relaxed to accept
the use of flags such as ?-std=f2008? in ?PKG_FFLAGS?. Hopefully, this
means future packages will have an easier time relying on more modern
features, albeit they are 5 or 15 years old by now :).

Thank you,

Avi

Ben, thank you for your response.

The text2sdg package was added on 24 January 2023.

I had created a drat repository called USA.state.boundaries.data to 
store the full set of maps (1 of which is needed for my iemisc package) 
and I had only a subset of the maps in the USA.state.boundaries package 
which appears on CRAN.

In order to submit the revised iemisc package to CRAN, I had to add the 
map data set from USA.state.boundaries.data which iemisc requires for 
key functions to the USA.state.boundaries package. I first tried to 
submit the revised USA.state.boundaries package with the map that iemisc 
requires to CRAN back in December 2022. I exchanged some e-mails with 
Uwe prior to the holiday break.

Hey Rich, thank you for your response.

In my case, I explained the reasoning to justify the 
USA.state.boundaries package being over 5 MB and why it is needed by 
iemisc, including providing previous e-mail discussions between Uwe and 
myself, on the various re-submittals of the USA.state.boundaries 
package.

Part of the reason why I wrote the e-mail to this list serve is that I 
have seen Uwe respond back to e-mail threads in this R-pkg-devel list, 
but I have not received any response from him nor any other CRAN 
volunteer since 6 January (almost a month as of today, 3 February 2023).

I responded back to Uwe on 6 January 2023.

In terms of Uwe and others being volunteers, I understand that 
completely. I myself volunteer on a variety of projects and I do a 
variety of projects for pay as well & I have done that for a couple of 
decades now.

I believe that a response should be made in less than a month's time.

Irucka

Speaking of reproducing the warnings, the CRAN checks pass -Wall
-Wstrict-prototypes -pedantic to the compiler, while on Rhub, only the
UB sanitizer is used without any statical analysis warning flags.

It may be possible to see the extra warnings if you set CFLAGS = -Wall

As complement to Duncan's nice answer I also suggest to use the function .Deprecated() for an additional transition time.
(see eg https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44622054/mark-a-function-as-deprecated-in-customised-r-package)

Baseline, if other people/packages use your package, alert them (via a message/warning due to .Deprecated()) and give them time to adopt...

I think your plan is good, though it is missing one step that should 
happen between 1 and 2:

Contact maintainers of all packages that use mvmesh and tell them what 
changes they need to make.  According to the CRAN page for mvmesh, 
that's just two packages, both of which you maintain:  gensphere, 
SphericalCubature, but you may know of others (e.g. on Bioconductor or 
elsewhere) who should be informed.

If those are the only two, then the step should be to send any necessary 
updates to them before proceeding to step 2.  When you do get to step 2, 
mention what steps you took to inform mvmesh users.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] How to update "SystemRequirements: C++11"?
Message-ID: <CAFOpNVFTGcrsURZC9TOv=KSceKr_WFPsMV0TJoCZKrppkkSFdw@mail.gmail.com>

I recently submitted a package to CRAN with "SystemRequirements: C++11".
This raises the following NOTE on R-devel, and I was asked to fix and
resubmit:

* checking C++ specification ... NOTE
  Specified C++11: please update to current default of C++17

If I understand correctly, I have two options, neither of which will work:
1. Remove "SystemRequirements: C++11" entirely. The problem with this is
that on systems with older versions of R (3.6 and below, I believe), it may
try to compile the package with an older C++ standard, which will fail.
2. Update it to "SystemRequirements: C++17". The problem here is that on
systems that don't have a C++17 compiler, the package won't build -- even
though the package only actually requires a C++11 compiler.

How should I deal with this?

Are you allowed to say "C++11 or C++17"?

Actually I can partially answer this:  the test is not based on 
SystemRequirements, but on the log of the build, which now contains 
lines like this:

   using C compiler: ?Apple clang version 12.0.0 (clang-1200.0.32.28)?
   using C++ compiler: ?Apple clang version 12.0.0 (clang-1200.0.32.28)?
   using C++11
   using SDK: ?MacOSX11.1.sdk?

I get "using C++11" because of this line in Makevars:

   CXX_STD = CXX11

So I guess the answer is to change your Makevars to make that line 
conditional on running under an old version of R.  If you figure out how 
to do that, could you post the recipe here?

One way to resolve that conundrum could be to add a configure script
that detects a C++17/C++14/C++11 compiler known to R and sets that in
Makevars. I haven't published an update on CRAN yet, but R CMD check
seems satisfied with this under multiple versions of R between 3.3 and
R-devel:

I believe this is closely related to this email [1]. Dirk and I and
Aymeric have been going through the same issue with nloptr as well.
Our current opinion is to leave it out, as it would restrict more
users to demand C++17, which is unneeded, than to have users with over
a decade old compiler which does not have C++11. Dirk and Aymeric,
please chime in if I have misstated. Regardless, according to
Professor Ripley, if you require specific features, you should mark
them in _both_ Makevars and SystemRequirements, which is implied in
the "r-devel" version of WRE which adds the words "also" in section
1.2.4.

Thanks,

Avi

Could you please point to the specific passage? According to [1],
section 1.2.4, declaring the C++ standard in SystemRequirements is
only mandatory for C++17 or later.

That doesn't refer to the SystemRequirements field.

No, but the prior sentence does. The complete excerpt is:

  ::Packages without a src/Makevars or src/Makefile file may specify a
C++ standard for code in the src directory by including something like
?C++14? in the ?SystemRequirements? field of the DESCRIPTION file,
e.g.
  ::::SystemRequirements: C++14
 ::If a package does have a src/Makevars[.win] file then also setting
the make variable ?CXX_STD? there is recommended, as it allows R CMD
SHLIB to work correctly in the package?s src directory.

So one is supposed to add the requirement to DESCRIPTION via
SystemRequitements. If there is a Makevars, one should ALSO set the
variable in there.

If you wish, I can forward you personal communication with Professor
Ripley from last week where he makes this clear as well.

Thanks,

Avi

After reading the discussion here and the manuals, I think this is how 
to do it.  I'm assuming your code is compatible with both C++11 and 
C++17, but not some earlier standards.

1.  In SystemRequirements, state that it needs C++11 or higher.  That 
field is supposed to be human readable (though I think there are scripts 
that try to read it; maybe they will suggest a particular wording to use).

2.  Have a configure script (e.g. like the one Ivan posted) that 
specifies CXX_STD=CXX11 in Makevars if the R version is less than 4.0.0, 
and gives no specification otherwise (because from 4.0.0 onwards, if C++ 
is available, it will be C++11 or higher).

I think it wouldn't hurt to look through the available versions and pick 
from them, but I don't think it's supposed to be necessary.

If it eventually turns out that your code is not compatible with some 
later standard, I'm sure CRAN will let you know.

Now that I think about it some more, I think I can do the following:

1. In the DESCRIPTION file, remove "SystemRequirements: C++11". I believe
this field is used only for R CMD check, not for actually installing
packages. CRAN only runs R CMD check on r-oldrel, r-release, and r-devel,
and all of those versions (4.1, 4.2, and 4.3) have C++11. For older
versions of R, the package might not pass R CMD check, but it will still
install (provided there's a C++11 compiler).

2. In my case, I think I can skip the configure script. This is because I
also have GNU Make as a requirement, and it allows you to conditionally set
the CXX_STD variable only when R < 4.0, by putting this in the Makevars
file:

R_VERSION=$(shell $(R_HOME)/bin/Rscript --vanilla -e 'if (getRversion()<4)
cat("lt4") else cat("ge4")')
ifeq ($(R_VERSION), lt4)
CXX_STD=CXX11
endif

No need. But with all due respect, in such a case, I do not agree with
Prof. Ripley. By no means I'm a native English speaker, but I'm quite
accustomed to the "MAY, SHOULD, MUST" language that is common in
software guidelines. And there is a clear "may" in the first sentence,
implying that you may, or may not, add this to SystemRequirements.
Therefore, with the current wording, adding the standard to
SystemRequirements is only mandatory in the case in which your minimum
supported version is above the default (which makes sense to me, BTW).

If this was meant to be always mandatory, I would suggest to the
authors of WRE to modify that section.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] R OpenCL on an AMD GPU
Message-ID: <cc5f12ed-0df3-9c27-842c-7ebc2dd5b5a9@gmx.de>

Hi,

I am trying to set up the CRAN package "OpenCL" to run on a Windows 10
machine with an AMD GPU (Radeon 7900 XTX).

I installed the AMD drivers (which carry the OpenCL.dll) and the
installation of OpenCL in R didnt work. So I also downloaded the AMD SDK
to set up the environment variables OCL64LIB, OCL32LIB and OCLINC. The
installation worked, but the built package was broke (OpenCL kernels
didnt execute due to a multiplicity of errors - the OpenCL set up must
have been wrong).

The installation of OpenCL was done with install.packages("OpenCL",
INSTALL_opts = "--no-test-load") trying it with and without the
install_opts option.

Does anyone have a clue?

Best regards,

Quirin

Quirin,

this is a contributed package question, so you should either use the GitHub issues (https://github.com/s-u/OpenCL/issues) for the package or contact the maintainer (me). But before you do so, you have to provide a lot more details including exact code you used and the full output of the errors you saw. Finally, on Windows, make sure you refer to the instructions posted here to pre-load your run-time DLL: https://github.com/s-u/OpenCL/issues/6#issuecomment-899114747

Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Problem with package containing spatial data
Message-ID: <CAHGVjrktvXFs=RA+sMTQiKTq=4v91wtt8tAAU2Y8ALWOJ=R4xA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'm developing a package that contains spatial data about public safety in
Rio de Janeiro.

The problem is that when I use the usethis::use_data function which
transforms the shapefile data into a file with the .rda extension, I cannot
use the geometry attribute to create a map.

E.g.:

# Raw-data script:

spatial_aisp <- sf::st_read('data-raw/shp_aisp/lm_aisp_2019.shp')

plot(spatial_aisp) # works

# Same data from .rda file after use usethis::use_data(spatial_aisp,
overwrite = TRUE)

x <- ispdata::spatial_aisp

plot(x) # do not work

Error message:
Error in data.matrix(x) :
  'list' object cannot be coerced to type 'double'


This is happening with all spatial data in the package. I'm using lazydata:
true and have already disabled file compression options, but the problem
persists.

Any ideas?

Scripts can be accessed at https://github.com/igorlaltuf/ispdata

Thanks!

I found that this strategy doesn't work. It turns out that R detects the
C++ version by simply grepping for CXX_STD in  the Makevars file, so even
with my fancy ifeq() statement, it still thinks that the package uses C++11.

So now my plan is to simply remove "CXX_STD" from Makevars and
"SystemRequirements: C++11" from DESCRIPTION. My understanding is that this
will cause the package to no longer build on R 3.5, but as of R 3.6.2,
C++11 became the default, so it should build on that version of R or higher.

Hi, I want to share the following information due to some of the 
feedback that I received with regards to the extreme lag on getting a 
response to my USA.state.boundaries package submissions.

The following text is taken verbatim from 
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html:

Submission

...

In more detail:

...

Once uploaded, no further submissions of that package should be made 
whilst the uploaded version is pending processing (which may take a few 
days) and you have not received a reply from a CRAN maintainer.




There is no question here, I just want to share information that will 
hopefully be useful to all of the R developers.

Thank you.

Hi Igor,
I?ve a couple packages that have spatial data in them that I maintain. I?ve opted to package up the data as a geopackage file and import it as an {sf} object. Edzer Pebesma suggests this to circumvent changes in the {sf} package from affecting native {sf} objects that are distributed as part of a package. Maybe this is an option for you?

In https://github.com/adamhsparks/extractOz, see /inst/extdata for the geopackage file and https://github.com/adamhsparks/extractOz/blob/main/R/data.R for handling the data importing and making available in the R session on package load.

Best,
Adam

Does this break in a new R session, but start working when you load the
sf namespace? I think that your package needs to depend on sf in order
for this to work. Specifying it in Imports may be enough to make the
plot.sf S3 method available to the user.

You may encounter other problems if you go this way, like R CMD check
complaining that you don't use the package you're importing. Loading
the data from a file on demand would also load the sf namespace and
thus solve the problem.

Specifying a package in the Imports field of DESCRIPTION guarantees that 
it will be available to load, but doesn't load it.  Importing something 
from it via the NAMESPACE triggers a load, as does executing code like 
pkg::fn, or explicitly calling loadNamespace("pkg"), or loading a 
package that does one of these things.

Hi Igor,

I had the same issue using terra rather than sf a couple of weeks ago.

I thought of solving the issue as follow:


   1.

   store the shapefiles under extdata.
   2.

   create a function that loads the files:

.build_internal_files <- function() {
  ## This function should not be called by the user.
  ## It performs the lazy loading of the data since terra cannot
handle rda files
  assign("CountryBorders",
terra::vect(system.file("extdata/CountryBorders.shp", package =
"IsoriX")), envir = as.environment("package:IsoriX"))
  assign("OceanMask", terra::vect(system.file("extdata/OceanMask.shp",
package = "IsoriX")), envir = as.environment("package:IsoriX"))
}


   1. call that function automatically upon attach using .onAttach():

.onAttach <- function(libname, pkgname) {
    .build_internal_files() ## lazy loading of the internal data
}

It seems to work...

Note that .onAttach() is a standard way of defining a function that is
recognised by R and ran when the package is attached.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] CRAN Vignette pdfs garbled in Firefox pdf viewer
Message-ID: <CAEbuDvKgn6YQM9LZRozRP_hzU0RXZEjVoPY4VVJu58xaMZrmvA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all, my package gcplyr has several vignettes which, from CRAN, appear
garbled when opened with Firefox's pdf viewer (
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gcplyr/index.html). Specifically,
instead of regular characters, there are numerous black-outlined white
boxes with text inside like "EO 88" or "EO 55". This doesn't occur with the
pdf vignettes on Github (https://github.com/mikeblazanin/gcplyr/). This
also doesn't occur when CRAN pdfs are opened with Chrome's pdf viewer or
Microsoft Edge's pdf viewer, nor when files are downloaded from CRAN and
opened with a local pdf viewer.

The issue was documented here:

Thank you all for your help.

Adam, I followed your suggestion, but I still can't figure out why the data
is only available locally when I run the devtools::load_all() function.

When I install the package from GitHub, the data does not appear (even
using the data() function).

Extdata: https://github.com/igorlaltuf/ispdata/tree/main/inst/extdata
Import: https://github.com/igorlaltuf/ispdata/blob/main/R/spatial_cisp.R

And is there any way to reduce the size of files in gpkg format? The
package increased from 5 to 10 megabytes. I tried to make it smaller with
the function sf::st_write("inst/extdata/spatial_aisp.gpkg", compress =
"deflate", append = F), but the size remained the same.

Thanks again for all the help.

I don't see a problem in Firefox 109.0.1 on a Mac.  Maybe the "0.1" is a 
bug fix?  Or maybe I looked in the wrong place.  Could you be very 
specific, i.e. URL, page, line.

Would these files ever be used when your package is not attached, e.g. 
through a function imported by a different package?  If so, you should 
use .onLoad(), not .onAttach().

Hi,

I can't read any vignettes of gcplyr in Firefox 109.0.1 from a Windows 10.
But sorry, I don't have any solution.

This is apparently  due to compression as needed fort package building, e.g., R CMD build --compact-vignettes=both --md5 --resave-data --log gap so mine has the same problem: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gap/vignettes/jss.pdf

Hi all, my package gcplyr has several vignettes which, from CRAN, appear
garbled when opened with Firefox's pdf viewer (
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gcplyr/index.html). Specifically,
instead of regular characters, there are numerous black-outlined white
boxes with text inside like "EO 88" or "EO 55". This doesn't occur with the
pdf vignettes on Github (https://github.com/mikeblazanin/gcplyr/). This
also doesn't occur when CRAN pdfs are opened with Chrome's pdf viewer or

opened with a local pdf viewer.

The issue was documented here:
https://github.com/mikeblazanin/gcplyr/issues/112

Anyone have any suggestions for what could be causing this?

Thanks!
Mike Blazanin

I reported the bug to bugzilla.

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1816128

The bug is already fixed.
We should use higher version of firefox or firefox nightly.

The problem has been around for a while for me and thank you for raising it -- esp. with a fix!

The bug is already fixed.
We should use higher version of firefox or firefox nightly.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] CRAN Vignette pdfs garbled in Firefox pdf viewer

Hi all, my package gcplyr has several vignettes which, from CRAN, appear
garbled when opened with Firefox's pdf viewer (
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gcplyr/index.html). Specifically,
instead of regular characters, there are numerous black-outlined white
boxes with text inside like "EO 88" or "EO 55". This doesn't occur with the
pdf vignettes on Github (https://github.com/mikeblazanin/gcplyr/). This
also doesn't occur when CRAN pdfs are opened with Chrome's pdf viewer or

opened with a local pdf viewer.

The issue was documented here:
https://github.com/mikeblazanin/gcplyr/issues/112

Anyone have any suggestions for what could be causing this?

Thanks!
Mike Blazanin

Hi, I am attempting to build my revised 'iemisc' package, but I am 
having trouble building one of the vignettes.

I am receiving the following error message:

* creating vignettes ...Error in find_vignette_product(name, by = 
"weave", dir = docdir, engine = engine) :
   Failed to locate ?weave? output file ?Engineering_Survey_Examples.pdf? 
or ?Engineering_Survey_Examples.html? for vignette with name 
?Engineering_Survey_Examples? and engine ?knitr::rmarkdown?.


This is odd because the following command correctly produces the PDF of 
the document:

library("rmarkdown")
render("/vignettes/Engineering_Survey_Examples.Rmd", 
pdf_document(latex_engine = "xelatex"))

I have attached the .Rmd file for the vignette to this e-mail.

Thank you.

Hi all. I uncovered the error that caused the vignette not to print.

It had to do with one of the functions in the vignette.

Thank you.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Unable to load Windows NETIO.SYS and WINSPOOL.DRV DLLs
Message-ID: <eb7d1d333a2797d098418d092f19bd4f3542ce51.camel@ed.ac.uk>

[I've posted this to r-devel, and just realised that I should have
posted it to this list instead - apologies to those on both lists for
the extra email.]

I am trying to build the RGtk2 package
(https://github.com/lawremi/RGtk2) using R-devel and only the libraries
bundled with RTookl4.3 (currently RGtk2 is bundled with a compiled dll
and requires GTK libraries to be downloaded after installation into R).

I have used the instructions at
https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/howto-R-4.2.html
to create a Makevars.win file (appended, including description of how
the PKG_LIBS have been set).

The package can be installed, but the shared object created can't be
loaded:

   > library(RGtk2)
   Error in inDL(x, as.logical(local), as.logical(now), ...) :
     unable to load shared object 'C:/Users/David
   Sterratt/AppData/Local/R/win-library/4.3/RGtk2/libs/x
   64/RGtk2.dll':
     LoadLibrary failure:  The specified module could not be found.

WinDbg output reveals errors loading "NETIO.SYS" and "WINSPOOL.DRV"
when running "library(RGtk2)":

   0c64:0640 @ 44312812 - LdrpProcessWork - ERROR: Unable to load DLL:

   ...
   0c64:1e5c @ 44312812 - LdrpProcessWork - ERROR: Unable to load DLL:

"C:\Users\David Sterratt\AppData\Local\R\win-
library\4.3\RGtk2\libs\x64\RGtk2.dll", Parent Module: "(null)", Status:
0xc0000135

I'm stuck at this point: I'm not a regular Windows User, and I've not
been able to find any trustworthy advice online about how to deal with
missing DLLs. Any help would be appreciated.

There is an issue on Github about this issue with full output from
WinDbg:
https://github.com/lawremi/RGtk2/issues/9

Best wishes,

David

The failure to load WINSPOOL.DRV is perplexing (it should normally be
possible to load as it's a system DLL that applications are supposed to
link against in order to be able to print), but NETIO.SYS should
probably be absent from the import list. At least it seems to be linked
against some kernel-related stuff that shouldn't be reachable from
userspace applications.

By removing -lnetio from PKG_LIBS, I was able to load the package and
run some example code from the JSS article, but then Rgui.exe crashed
on exit. I'm running R-4.2.2 and Rtools43 on a Windows 7 machine, which
could also be a source of the difference.

Does the Dependency Walker <https://dependencywalker.com/> provide you
any useful information about the package DLL besides what you already
know? (Some warnings deep in the dependency tree are to be expected.
R.DLL is not on the PATH so won't be automatically found, but other
dependencies should exist.)

Note that Gtk2 is end of life, Gtk4 was released 3 years ago already.
There are reasons why neither the former RGtk2 maintainer nor the CRAN 
team decided to maintain RGtk2 further on.

Thank you. I know that Gtk2 is end-of-life, but I was thinking that the
inclusion of the Gtk2 library in RTools4.3 meant that it was still seen
as usable. I have an R package that is built around the gWidgets2RGtk2
interface  - it had some features that the Tcl/Tk interface didn't
have.

Anyway, *supposing* that someone wanted to investigate updating RGtk2
to RGtk4 and upload the updated package to CRAN, what would be the
possible approaches (if any) to include the RGtk4 libraries, so that
the package could be compiled on the CRAN build servers? Either (1)
include the Gtk4 source code (and any necessary dependencies) in the R
package; or (2) have RGtk4 dev libraries installed on build servers
(I'm assuming that they are not currently installed).

Best wishes,

David

Thank you for looking at this. I tried removing -lnetio, but package
didn't install at all on Windows 10.

I looked at the Dependency Walker, but it was giving me many messages
about missing DLLs with names like:

  API-MS-WIN-CORE-STRING-L2-1-0.DLL  Error opening file. The system
cannot find the file specified (2).

These libraries seem to be part of the UCRT system. However, when
looked at the DLL of a package that *did* load in Dependency Walker, I
got the same messages, so I think the path to the UCRT files may be
missing.

Dependency Walker did seem to find:

  c:\windows\system32\WINSPOOL.DRV

For NETIO.SYS it gave the " Error opening file. The system cannot find
the file specified (2)." There was also this table in the output.

     [ ? ] NETIO.SYS

If you're really interested, I can send you the output, but from what
Uwe says, I'm wondering if this is a lost cause!

Best wishes,

David.

If you need some details, perhaps simply ask Michael Lawrence.
He certainly knows better than most readers what the issues are, or at 
least were when RGtk2 got archived.

For reference, there is an old patch for RGtk2 package that I had 
created when working on Rtools42, though I am not very optimistic it 
will help in this case:

https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/r_packages/old_patches/CRAN/RGtk2.diff

I've added gtk2 libraries to Rtools42 as they were needed by a CRAN 
package (RGtk2) at that time and available in MXE. Now MXE has gtk3, but 
not gtk4.

If there is a need for gtk4 in a CRAN package, the best way forward 
would be to contribute gtk4 build configuration to MXE, ideally also 
after testing it builds as part of Rtools43 (which is a subset of MXE 
but with some updates not yet upstream). We could then replace gtk2 by 
gtk4 in Rtools. CRAN servers will then get gtk4 simply via updating Rtools.

This is only what would be needed for Windows. For macOS, gtk4 would 
have to be added to the recipes. For Linux, the package should work with 
gtk4 distributions available in main distributions.

If you wanted to use gtk from a package, perhaps it would be easier to 
try directly, not via the archived RGtk2 package.

Many thanks. I've not tried this patch yet, but it looks like it's not
made the development version of RGtk2, which is what I had been working
with. I will try out the archived RGtk2_2.20.36.3.tar.gz

This is helpful to know, as it suggests that if RGtk2 could be updated
to work with Gtk4, installed into MXE, and if the Mac recipies could be
updated, the changes RTools might be accepted, and then RGtk2 (perhaps
renamed RGtk4) might be uploadable to CRAN.

From this message, and Uwe's it's clear that the long-term future of
RGtk2 depends on an update to Gtk4, and I've asked the maintainer about
what the prospects of that might be:

Yes, it was for the CRAN version (when it was still on CRAN). It is very 
likely you would have to manually update the list of libraries to link 
in this complicated case, after what you get from the script. As it was 
well illustrated also by Ivan's findings.

In principle it is easy to add any open-source software with a 
compatible license, but someone has to volunteer to do the work of 
adding it to and maintaining it in the software distributions used, and 
of persuading the maintainers of those distributions to accept it.

Hi Mike, Shota and all,

Upon update to Firefox 110 (ahead of the nightly 112) this morning the bug is also fixed.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] CRAN Vignette pdfs garbled in Firefox pdf viewer

Hi all, my package gcplyr has several vignettes which, from CRAN, appear
garbled when opened with Firefox's pdf viewer (
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gcplyr/index.html). Specifically,
instead of regular characters, there are numerous black-outlined white
boxes with text inside like "EO 88" or "EO 55". This doesn't occur with the
pdf vignettes on Github (https://github.com/mikeblazanin/gcplyr/). This
also doesn't occur when CRAN pdfs are opened with Chrome's pdf viewer or

opened with a local pdf viewer.

The issue was documented here:
https://github.com/mikeblazanin/gcplyr/issues/112

Anyone have any suggestions for what could be causing this?

Thanks!
Mike Blazanin

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Package submission rejected as it fails checks on
 Debian
Message-ID: <9f139ef7aa30500603cc4230b7346e81@uop.gr>

Dear R-developers, I apologize for posting something that has probably 
been discussed before (but missed it while searching the archives).

While trying to submit a newer version of my package to CRAN, it is 
rejected as it fails on Debian. I will call this package APACKAGE below 
(although it is named differently). It has passed all checks on my 
Windows system (no errors or warnings).

The package (for many versions now) is configured as follows:
Imports: 	Rcpp , methods
LinkingTo: 	Rcpp
Suggests: 	R.rsp

The previous version of the package (already on CRAN) shows no errors on 
CRAN checks, only NOTES for some platforms. Interestingly, a couple of 
days ago I checked the CRAN checks and noticed that this exact 
(previous) version of the package had one ERROR indicated, occurring in 
some Debian flavor (r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-gcc, if I remember 
correctly). I changed nothing, but now it shows no errors for all 
platforms (including Debian).

Now I am trying to submit a newer version and it not accepted as it 
fails on Debian. Checking the log I see no syntax errors or warnings.

** testing if installed package can be loaded from temporary location
Error: package or namespace load failed for ?APACKAGE? in dyn.load(file,

I tried the R-Hub builder and it also fails for Platform Debian Linux, 
R-devel, GCC. The process goes fine until the following:

It maybe something obvious, but I really cannot think of what else to 
try to fix this issue.
Any help will be greatly appreciated.

Hi, Vasileios:


	  Do you have it on GitHub?


	  If yes, do you use "GitHub Action" to test the package on multiple 
platforms?  I'm a contributor to the "fda" package.  It's version on 
GitHub is configured so every "git push" triggers auto tests on five 
different platforms, testing it against the current "release" version of 
R on the latest versions of macOS, Windows and Ubuntu plus the 
development and previous release on Ubuntu.[1]  I don't know if GitHub 
action would support testing under Debian nor if testing under Ubuntu 
would catch the problem that CRAN is catching on Debian.


	  However, having the package on GitHub also makes it easier for 
someone else to clone the package and test it it for you ;-) This 
community of R developers provides very valuable support for problems 
like this.


	  Hope this help.
	  Spencer Graves

Hello Spencer and thank you for your reply.

This is a good point as the package is indeed on GitHub, so I will 
investigate it. But, like you pointed out, it is doubtful if testing on 
these other systems (including Ubuntu) will catch a problem that is 
reported on Debian.

And what causes it seems even more of a mystery to me.

Thanks again.
V.

Can you share the repo URL?  It may be a a fairly simple and standard issue
some of us can spot easily.

Oh yes thank you. I just realized I did not mention the repo on my

Thanks for that -- I can confirm the error.

The packages compiles all source files without issue or warnings (under my
default flags), links and then fails to load with the error you reported:

  ** testing if installed package can be loaded from temporary location
  Error: package or namespace load failed for ?nnlib2Rcpp? in dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...):
   unable to load shared object '/tmp/rcpp/lib/00LOCK-nnlib2Rcpp/00new/nnlib2Rcpp/libs/nnlib2Rcpp.so':
    /tmp/rcpp/lib/00LOCK-nnlib2Rcpp/00new/nnlib2Rcpp/libs/nnlib2Rcpp.so: undefined symbol: _ZTIN6nnlib25layerE
  Error: loading failed
  Execution halted
  ERROR: loading failed

Now, `c++filt` on that symbol reveals

  $ c++filt _ZTIN6nnlib25layerE
  typeinfo for nnlib2::layer
  $

and a glance at your header nnlib2::layer reveals that the class is virtual.
I don't have time right to do more digging but if I had to guess you may have
a slip up somewhere in your classes: something that worked beforehand with
your virtual (abstract) classes and derived (concrete) classes now seems to
want an concrete instance of 'layer'.  And if I had to guess some more the
reason this works in Windows is that the linker there is more lenient.

Maybe you can try an earlier version of nnlib2Rcpp and then bisect the
changes.  rhub gives you (fairly) easy access to Linux machines for builds
outside of your main Windows machine.

Sorry I cannot be of more help right now.

Thanks for taking the time to check it. The hint about the virtual 
'layer' class is valuable.
I will look into it.
Best Regards,
V.Nikolaidis

PS I am tempted to set up a Debian test platform to speed up fixing the 
package.
(Or abandon submitting the package to CRAN alltogether.)

Sounds good, glad to have been of assistance.  On a lark, I also tried your

I love working on Linux. And these days I hear from some friends that having
WSL2 on a (recent enough) Windows computer is also good as it effectively
gives a second machine with Ubuntu on it.  Docker can also be helpful, as are
the online resources -- rhub has helped me with both macos and windows builds.

Yes, with all this I can think where I may have messed up. So thanks for 
the help, at least it verified it is indeed an issue with the code. As 
far as OSs, I use Ubuntu variants a lot and (on several machines) but 
these days I have easier access to Windows (with WSL2 btw). I also like 
a strict compiler (and linker), there is usually a reason why they are 
strict. So if it is not obvious from examining the code,  I will set up 
something (be it WSL, VM or Docker) for testing.

Thanks again,

Vasilis

	  If you have NOT tried "GitHub Action" yet, I highly recommend it. 
For my packages, every time I do "git push", it automatically runs "R 
CMD build / check" on 5 different platforms -- with no further effort on 
my part other than checking the results.


	  It should be easy to get something to work following the instructions 
in Wickham and Bryan, R Packages[1] or copying the code from another 
package.[2] If that fails, you might be able to get help from this list. 
  I got valuable suggestions from Dir Eddelbuettel and Duncan Murdoch.


	  I don't know if any version of Debian is available on GitHub Action. 
However, if CRAN is rejecting your package on GitHub Action, a question 
about that to this list might help make it available.  If you have 
special Ubuntu configuration issues that are not provided in the 
standard GitHub Action configurations, asking here might help you with 
that.


	  Hope this helps,
	  Spencer Graves

I will try it the "Github Action" it seems very useful indeed.

I already found the (extremely obvious and tiny) error that caused all 
this mess. I am surprised the compile/link system on my Windows machine 
passed on that without reporting anything. That really threw me off on 
what the cause may be. Getting back on Linux for development and checks 
(like I used to use and trust).

Problem solved, moral of the story is never code tired, and use all 
tools available.
Thank you everyone for your comments and help.

Regards,
Vasilis.

[ Sorry, but for once I'd like to raise this here ...]:

well... how many "trees" does that cost every time you push?
I guess it will be less than one, but I'd also guess it be more
than 1% of one.. and even if that was more than reality, ...

I hope you are all aware that even though this looks "free", all
this mostly unnecessary (rebuilding some of the things *every*
time from scratch, downloading lots of stuff, even though from a
closeby server) traffic and server run time will partly be paid
by the kids and grand kids of people living in Bangladesh,
Polynesia, ... (and maybe even in say Amsterdam)
Global Warming *is* a threat, and we living in rich nations letting run
more and more computer networks and servers (cooling, heating,
gray energy including lots of CO2 produce by building construction, ...)
does add to it.

[[[yes, I may be partly wrong,  and
    no, it's a loss of time if we start a flame/mud/... war here about this;
    just consider it a small outlier voice ...
]]]

Hi Martin.

I think your calculations are way off.  A one-tonne tree contains about 
5000 kWh of energy.  A typical computer server uses about 200 watts, and 
can process many jobs simultaneously on different cores, but let's say 
the whole server is dedicated to the Github action.  Then it would 
consume 1 kWh in 5 hours, and would take about 10 days to consume 1% of 
a tree.

   Not important (of course) but where does the 5000 kWh per tree number 
come from?  Is that (dry weight) x (50% carbon per dry weight) / (carbon 
content of CO2 emissions per kWh) ?

https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator#results

   If we say 200 watts x 15 minutes (allowing us to take up the whole 
server for checking on 5 different platforms) we have .05 kWh. Let's say 
we do this 300 times/year for a package, so 15 kWh. Hard to get 'tree 
equivalents' from the EPA web site, but this is equivalent to 1.2 
gallons of petrol/gasoline consumption (0.011 metric tonnes)

That's just made up, but it is close to the numbers here for dry wood:

   https://wood-energy.extension.org/energy-basics/

The 1 tonne weight of dry wood for a "tree" is also made up.

Another missing part of the calculation is how many kWh are saved 
because frequent checks find bugs early and prevent the need to throw 
away long simulation runs.

And Github claims to have been carbon neutral since 2019...

Hi everyone,

I am trying to submit a new package in CRAN. The results from devtools::check() returned with no errors, warnings, nor notes. Upon submitting the package tarball, i received the following error on the r-devel-windows-x86_64 version:

Check: whether package can be installed, Result: ERROR

 See 'd:/RCompile/CRANincoming/R-devel/qPCRhelper.Rcheck/00install.out' for details.

Greetings, I am attaching the complete R file for your review. The 
vlookup_internal function and all of the functions in the package are 
derived from the expss package version 0.10.7. The vlookup function was 
modified in later versions so I gathered what I needed from that 
previous version and included in the attached R file.

The vlookup_internal function is meant to be an internal function that 
is used by the vlookup and other functions. I have documented the 
vlookup_internal function to escape the warning message, but it doesn't 
seem to work.

I am enclosing the warning message below:

* checking for missing documentation entries ... WARNING
Undocumented code objects:
   ?vlookup_internal?
All user-level objects in a package should have documentation entries.
See chapter ?Writing R documentation files? in the ?Writing R
Extensions? manual.

Thank you.

Irucka Embry

If it's an internal-only function check if it's exported in your NAMESPACE
file.

I'm not very familiar with Roxygen, so I might be making incorrect
assumptions here.

Why are you exporting a function if it's meant to be internal?

And the @noRd would indicate that a documentation file is not created. I
would remove @noRd or @export

You have included the @export tag in the roxygen block for vlookup_internal(), which will place it in the NAMESPACE with an export directive, but also included @noRd which prevents the creation of the .Rd file for the function. So these two are in conflict. Remove the @export tag from vlookup_internal and when you re-run devtools::document() it should no longer be in the NAMESPACE.

Cheers,

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Sanitize Input Code for a Shiny App
Message-ID: <013901d94a19$9b8569f0$d2903dd0$@denney.ws>

Hello,

 

I'm working to develop a Shiny app where I'd like to have an advanced
capability to accept user input and run the code.  For the code received,
I'd like to be able to prevent R from doing things other than working within
the R session.  For example, I want to prevent `system("rm -rf /*")`.

 

One method to achieve this is to run the R session within a Docker container
and perform the security around the container.  The user could do some
things within the container, but they would be limited.

 

What I'd like to be able to do is to sanitize the inputs to ensure that it
won't to things including installing packages, running system commands,
reading and writing to the filesystem, and accessing the network.  I'd like
to allow the user to do almost anything they want within R, so making a list
of acceptable commands is not accomplishing the goal.  I could try to do
something like:

 

*	have acceptable packages loaded, only,
*	don't allow loading additional packages,
*	deny a set of known-bad commands (e.g. system, system2, etc.)
*	deny any attempt to run from additional packages (exclude calls with
a double-colon or triple-colon)

 

The method I just described seems like it would not work well because it
assumes that the known-bad commands is comprehensive and that I'm being
creative enough in ways that users could try to break things.

 

Is there a good way to sanitize arbitrary code from users to prevent
malicious behavior?


Thanks,

 

Bill

How untrusted will the user be?

You will most likely have to forbid Rcpp and any similar packages (and
likely anything that depends on them), because running arbitrary C++
will definitely include system commands, filesystem I/O and sockets.

To think of it, you will also have to forbid dyn.load(): otherwise it's
relatively easy to compile a ELF shared object that would load on any
64-bit Linux and provide an entry point that performs a system call of
the user's choice.

While the base R packages set R_forceSymbols(dll, TRUE) on their
.C/.Call/.Fortran/.External routines, making them unavailable to a bare
.Call("symbol_name", whatever_arguments, ...), some of the packages
deemed acceptable might provide C symbols without disabling the dynamic
lookup, and those C symbols may be convinced to run user-supplied code
either by mistake of the programmer (user supplies data, programmer
misses a buffer overrun or a use-after-free, suddenly data gets
executed as code; normally not considered a security issue because "the
user is already on the inner side of the airtight hatchway and could
have run system()") or even by design (the C programmer relied on the
R code to provide safety features). CRAN checks with Valgrind and
address-/undefined behaviour sanitizers help a lot against this kind of
C bugs, but they aren't 100% effective. Either way, top-level .C and
friends must be forbidden too. (Forbidding them anywhere in the call
chain will break almost all of R, even lm() and read.table().)

A CRAN package deemed acceptable may still have system() shell
injections in it and other ways to convince it to run user code.

The triple-colon protection can probably be bypassed in lots of clever
ways, starting with a perfectly normal R function `get()` combined with
a package function that has the private symbols visible to it. Similar
techniques may bypass the top-level .C/dyn.load()/system() restrictions.

Will the user be allowed to upload data? I think that R's serialization
engine is not designed to handle untrusted data. It has known stack
overflows [*], so a dedicated attacker is likely to be able to find a
code execution pathway from unserialize().

R code is also data, so a "forbidden" function or call could be
smuggled as data, parsed/deserialized and then evaluated. There are
standard classes in at least one of the base packages that use a lot of
closures, so a print() call on a doctored object can already be running
user-supplied code. You may forbid parse(), but some well-meaning code
inside R or a CRAN package may be convinced to run as.formula() on a
string, which may be enough for an attacker.

Some simple restrictions may be implemented by recursively walking the
return value of parse(user_input), but that ignores the possibility of
attacks on the parser itself. More significant restrictions may require
you to patch R and somehow determine at the point of an unsafe
(socket() / dlopen() / system() / ...) call whether it's
user-controlled or required for R to function normally (or both?).

I think it's a better idea to put the user-controlled process in a
virtual machine or a container or use a sandbox such as firejail or
bubblewrap. Make R run as an unprivileged user (this matters much less
once inside a sandbox, but let's not help the attacker skip privilege
escalation exploits before they try sandbox breakout exploits). Put
some firewall rules into place. Some attackers will doubtlessly try to
run a cryptocurrency miner without destroying the system/sending
spam/breaching your data, so make sure to limit CPU time, the size of
the temporary storage you're giving to the process and the amount of
RAM it can allocate.

In a game of walls and ladders, nothing will give you perfect
protection from attackers breaking out of such a sandbox (have I
mentioned the Spectre-class attack on the branch predictor in most
modern CPUs that makes it (very very hard but) possible to read from
address space not belonging to your process? The rowhammer attack on
non-ECC DRAM that (probabilistically) overwrites memory that is not
yours?), but in this case, the operating system is in a much better
position to restrict the user than R itself. Some languages (like Lua)
have such a tiny standard library that putting them in a sandbox is a
simple exercise, though both parser and bytecode execution
vulnerabilities (which might lead to code execution) still surface from
time to time. (SQLite went through a lot of fuzz-testing before its
authors could say that both its SQL parser and its database file parser
were safe against attacker-supplied input.) R (and the packages you
might want to run) just weren't designed with the idea of being a
security boundary on the user input side.

The JavaScript engines running in our browsers (well, the 2.5 browser
engines that are left) try to provide both the sandbox and the
performance to go with it, at the cost of a never-ending stream of
client-side vulnerabilities that have to be frequently patched. The
Python project now has Pyodide <https://pyodide.org/en/stable/>, an
interpreter that runs in the client's browser instead of your server,
which shifts the costs and the liabilities of user-supplied code on the
user. Maybe it's time to try to compile R for the browser?

Bill,

the short answer is you can't limit anything at R level. Any attempts to create a list of "bad" commands are trivial to circumvent since you can compute on the language in R, so you can construct and call functions with trivial operations. Similarly, since R allows the loading of binary code the same applies for arbitrary code. So if you give users access to R, you should assume that is equivalent to allowing arbitrary code execution. Therefore all you can do is limit the resources and reach - as you pointed out using a container is a good idea so each session is only limited to a single container that goes away when the session ends. Similarly you can restrict main parts of R and the system to be read-only in the container.

In practice, that's why real analytic systems are about provenance rather than prevention. For example, in RCloud all code is first committed to a git repository outside of the container before it can be executed, so malicious users can do whatever they want, but they cannot hide the malicious code they used as the container cannot manipulate the history.

As for package installation - again, it's impossible to prevent it in general unless you make everything read-only which also prevents the users from doing meaningful work. So the real question what do you want to allow the user to do - why would you need to allow literal R code evaluation? The other alternative is to simply limit the interaction not allowing the user to submit arbitrary code, only tweak parameters or use GUI to select particular choices. Obviously, that is a lot easier to secure.

Cheers,
Simon

Dear R-developers,

I apologize if this issue has been already resolved, I could not find any
solution in your archives.

I recently submitted a package to CRAN. In the "src/Makevars" file I
put CXX_STD
= CXX11 to specify C++11 code. This causes my package to fail the automatic
checks, which raise the following note:

*"checking C++ specification ... NOTE*
* Specified C++11: please drop specification unless essential"*

Specifying C++11 is necessary to make my package work. How can I solve
this?

You could change the code so it will work in newer standards, but if 
that is not feasible, you need to write to CRAN and explain why you need 
this older standard.

Is it C++11 exactly or C++ ? 11? If the former, you're 100% right to
specify this (but may have problems in unspecified future when someone
decides to stop supporting C++11). If the latter, the answer is more
complicated, especially if you want your package to continue working on
older versions of R.

My own solution is to use the default C++ standard on R ? 3.6.2, i.e.
omit the CXX_STD specification entirely (which is at least C++11 there,
and my code has been tested on C++11 to C++17), but explicitly request
at least C++11 on R ? 3.1 using a configure script:
https://github.com/aitap/Ropj/commit/cc94320bd5b8b68c879ff604787e71831fff8108

Prior to R-3.1, there seems to have been no way to ask for C++11, so I
don't expect my code to work there.

As explained there (https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/issues/3407#issuecomment-1426249703) "R 4.1.0, the base of the current r-oldrel (aka "previous release") already defaulted to C++14."


So, unless you really need C++11 and cannot use newer standards, you can probably remove

CXX_STD = CXX11


Best,

R.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Ignoring a compiler warning?
Message-ID: <d4cbfd4b-0a4c-e724-ee55-2ff1421b8f87@gmail.com>

I am in the process of updating rgl to use the glad loader 
(https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad).  This replaces system standard gl.h 
and glext.h files with new ones that include function pointers to be 
filled in at run-time, so that rgl can use OpenGL features supported by 
updated drivers if they are present.

However, I'm getting a NOTE from checking:

File which contains pragma(s) suppressing diagnostics:
   ?src/ext/glad/include/glad/gl.h?

It is correct:  that file contains this:

#ifdef __clang__
#pragma clang diagnostic push
#pragma clang diagnostic ignored "-Wreserved-id-macro"
#endif
#ifdef __gl_h_
   #error OpenGL (gl.h) header already included (API: gl), remove 
previous include!
#endif
#define __gl_h_ 1

... more like this ...


The compiler would issue a warning for defining "__gl_h_" because of the 
two leading underscores.

Is that an ignorable NOTE, or if not, is there some acceptable way to 
suppress it?

There is not (AFAIK), and package BH has edited out such pragmas for many
years (as have other packages, I think it bites me in at least one other
package). In essence I recursively search for '#pragma clang diagnostic
ignored' and ditto for gcc and precede the line with //. The BH repo has the
diffs in a subdirectory. And not that it matters because I do not get to make
the rules, but I also consider this wrong as it makes builds _much_ more
'noisy' leading to the real possibiity of missing more meaningful message.

Hi Simon and Ivan,

Thanks for confirming my suspicions.  The most common case for our code
would be generally trusted users within an organization.  So, the main
threat is lower.  But, there may be scenarios that also allow use outside
organizations.

I think that in the end, we will likely do some minimal sanitization of the
input, but then we will also ensure that we do anything in a container with
limits applied from the outside, too.

Thanks,

Bill

For the record, here's the documentation of the Prolog sandbox,

https://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/doc/_SWI_/library/sandbox.pl

You get an idea of the implementation by clicking at the ":-" icons. It does not seem too complicated, but I might be too optimistic. It would be very nice to have such a thing in R, and I would be willing to help if someone takes the lead.

 From my (very quick) look at the page, my understanding is that it is 
analyzing Prolog code to decide whether it is safe to execute or not. If 
my reading is correct, please let me reiterate that this would not be a 
good strategy for R. As Simon already wrote, R is a very dynamic 
language allowing to change almost anything at runtime. It is not 
possible to correctly and effectively reason about what an R program 
could do. Trying to do this would be a waste of effort which might only 
provide false sense of security. R cannot be made safe for such uses 
this way. While enough as a show stopper, it is more than that, R 
doesn't have a specification, any such tools would have to be written 
against a specific R release. Also, in practice one would probably also 
want to use some extension packages, which may again do anything (in 
native code).

With R, I would only think of ensuring security at the machine level, as 
discussed already - via virtual machines, containers (with care, not all 
are sandboxes), etc. That would be much safer, much less work, and could 
re-use existing technologies.

Dear Tomas,

thank you, I understand. The thing I was wondering about, and sorry for being persistent: Prolog is basically the same, it is similarly dynamic, and anything can be changed at runtime (well, unsure if I can redefine pi in Prolog ?), and still they run a ?swish? server (swish.swi-prolog.org), based on a list of allowed predicates considered to be safe. Of course, this generalization may a bit superficial, and something similar for R would probably boil down to a rather restricted set of functions (e.g., quite limited support for ?apply? and friends, no packages).

I?ll think about it and I?ll come back if I happen to put together a proof of concept.

Best wishes,

Matthias

could do. Trying to do this would be a waste of effort which might only 
provide false sense of security. R cannot be made safe for such uses 
this way. While enough as a show stopper, it is more than that, R 
doesn't have a specification, any such tools would have to be written 
against a specific R release. Also, in practice one would probably also 
want to use some extension packages, which may again do anything (in 
native code).

With R, I would only think of ensuring security at the machine level, as 
discussed already - via virtual machines, containers (with care, not all 
are sandboxes), etc. That would be much safer, much less work, and could 
re-use existing technologies.

Not shown anymore, I guess ome hicc up on the check machine.
Or in case you download data some internet access issue?

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Tools for reducing dependencies?
Message-ID: <8055110c-82e9-4b58-3a29-2efed0a61f8a@gmail.com>

The rgl package has a really large number of dependencies, especially if 
I include soft (Suggested) dependencies.  It would be nice to reduce 
that number.

To do that, I can imagine a tool that gives the following information:

  - For each export from rgl, which dependencies are needed?

  - For each dependency, which exports are supported?

  - Are there other ways to get the same support with fewer 
dependencies? E.g. if rgl used devtools::install_github, it could be 
replaced with remotes::install_github.

Does a tool already exist that addresses these questions?

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] First CRAN submission - quick feedback
Message-ID: <1841500546.5778.1678652414953@ud-mail.de>

Hi r-package-devel,

we'll soon make our first submission to CRAN (hopefully). While there's still stuff to do* and while we're waiting for an update to one of the dependencies I'd kindly like to ask if anyone would mind taking a quick look at the repository to assess if the overall structure seems fine.

Here's the repo: https://github.com/haganjam/FW_invert_biomass_allometry

One thing is that the package requires a couple of database files, which are about 20 MB in size and rather growing than shrinking. A standalone data package didn't seem like a good solution to me, so I added a zzz.R file to load the required files on install time (well, initialization / load time, it is). Makes sense to me but I don't know if this will be fine with CRAN.

Thanks a lot in advance and have a great week!
Cheers

Generally you will want to use an application directory for storing these
files (a la rappdirs) and, importantly, allow the user to consent to these
files being downloaded and installed, which should not be done on load.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] OpenCL R packages on CRAN
Message-ID: <79b5d7f3-1629-a5c4-367c-bfe2be79c7ca@gmx.de>

Hi,

I would like to ask what the current situation is regarding R packages
for computations on the GPU. There are no more official CRAN packages
using CUDA or OpenCL as foundation. There are only packages providing
either access to OpenCL, tensorflow or similar and packages using
directives in C++ via OpenMP.

My aim is to provide an R package using OpenCL. However, as far as I
know, such package would not run in Windows. Does CRAN accept packages
which are not compatible with every os?

Best regards

CRAN asks for cross plattform code if possible. In some situations where 
it is not possible to provide cross plattform code, CRAN also accepts 
code that works for many (but not all) plattforms.

OpenCL and Windows: Why would a package using OpenCL not work on Windows?
We may have difficulties providimg binaries of the package (and checking 
it) as corresponding graphics hardware is not available on the 
build/check machines, but if possible you shopudl support that users 
with the required hardware can compile the package from sources on 
Windows, too.

Best,
Uwe Ligges

Does it happen all the time? I used to binge-read PhD Comics, and they
timed out on me from time to time, but then worked again. Currently, I
can access this URL with a HEAD request using cURL over Tor, which
should have raised a lot of red flags if they were using a bot detector.

Dear list members.

I have run into a problem with examples from my package growthPheno (https://github.com/briencj/growthPheno) that take more than 10 s to execute on two flavours under r-devel. The following is the details.log:

Flavor: r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-gcc, r-devel-windows-x86_64
Check: CRAN incoming feasibility, Result: Note_to_CRAN_maintainers
  Maintainer: 'Chris Brien mailto:chris.brien at adelaide.edu.au'

Flavor: r-devel-windows-x86_64
Check: examples, Result: NOTE
  Examples with CPU (user + system) or elapsed time > 10s
                               user system elapsed
  probeSmooths 13.56     0.15     13.73
  traitSmooth     13.03     0.10     13.13

When I run the examples on laptop and a desktop running Windows 10 under r-devel with all packages updated, the elapsed times were 4.26 and 4.45, respectively i.e. much less than on the CRAN platforms. These timings were achieved using the following function call from RStudio (2022.12.0 Build 353):

> devtools::check("growthPheno", manual=FALSE, check_dir="D:/Analyses/R",
+                 args="--as-cran", env_vars = c(NOT_CRAN = "false"))

I have also submitted the package to rhub using the following command:

 rhub::check_for_cran(path = "growthPheno_2.1.18.tar.gz",
               env_vars = c(`_R_CHECK_FORCE_SUGGESTS_` = "false",
               `_R_CHECK_CRAN_INCOMING_USE_ASPELL_` = "false"),
               email = "chris.brien at adelaide.edu.au") with the following results for timing:

The timing results were:

   Examples with CPU (user + system) or elapsed time > 5s
                                  user system elapsed
    probeSmooths   6.50     0.09       6.64
   traitSmooth         6.02     0.03      6.04

While these are higher than the timings on my machines, they are half those reported on in the details.log resulting from my CRAN submission.

In order to be able to pass the CRAN tests, I have reduced the examples so that the timings on my laptop are (sessionInfo is below):

                              user system elapsed
probeSmooths    2.32    0.06    2.45
traitSmooth     3.47    0.09    3.73

and, using rhub::check_for_CRAN, the timings > 5 s are:

                            user system elapsed
probeSmooths 5.16      0.07     6.42

The difficulty I am having is that I cannot be sure that the timings for r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-gcc and r-devel-windows-x86_64 will be under 10 s, as seems to be required, if I were to resubmit the package to CRAN with the reduced examples.

I would be grateful to anyone who can suggest how I might go about determining the CRAN timings without submitting the package to CRAN.

Cheers,

 Chris

   I would try running them on https://win-builder.r-project.org/ . If 
the Windows timings are OK on that platform I think you can make a good 
case to CRAN that you've done your best ...

I think that win-builder R-devel <https://win-builder.r-project.org/> is
the same machine as the CRAN r-devel-windows-x86_64 machine (at the very
least, the CPU description of win-builder matches that from
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_flavors.html#r-devel-windows-x86_64>).

The package review is both a defining feature of CRAN and its
rate-limiting step. With the number of CRAN packages rising almost
exponentially and the burden of responsibility only increasing (various
kinds of supply-chain attacks becoming a frequent occurrence over at
the more popular NPM and PyPI repositories), there is increasingly more
reason for CRAN reviewers to fail safe and reject some false positives.

All that is a long way to say that sometimes CRAN reviewers make
mistakes. Does the rejection e-mail tell you whether you can appeal? I
think it says something like "please reply-all and explain", but make
sure to check yourself (i.e. the rules on whether you should
reply-to-all or reply-to-sender may have changed). I have argued my way
out of a rejection once, but only because there was an easy way to show
the mistake on the reviewer's part.

Were there any NOTEs about files being left after the R CMD check
run (or any other NOTEs or WARNINGs)? Does the rejection e-mail tell you
where is the offending write function?

Looking at your package, I see the calls to cat(..., file = ...) and
writeLines(file = ...). You may need to demonstrate in your reply that
they all live under tools/* and are only called during the package
configuration. Any other places where you may be writing to files from
R code? I also see a cat() call in a summary() method; it's probably not
the reason for rejection.

There's also the use of std::ofstream in the C++ code under src/*. Is
the writeOutput() function used anywhere? You could try to demonstrate
that there are no calls to this function, hence there is no way C++
code could write files where it's not welcome to do so.

If there's no way to appeal the rejection, that's more problematic
because the rules say you now have to submit a version of the package
that is different in both the version number and the content. In that
case, (assuming there's really no way for the package to write files in
user directories) hide the writeOutput() function behind an #ifdef or
even remove it if possible (put it on a separate branch if you use it
for other purposes elsewhere) and put the rest of the explanation about
the code under tools/* in the submission comment.

Good luck!

Message-ID: <2c40c4ab71734309917f7e914887ddd3@tiho-hannover.de>

I am currently building a package which uses the "limma"-package as a dependency.

I want to submit my package to CRAN.

Do I need to declare Bioconductor-dependencies such as Limma differently in the Description-File of my Package?

The Check-Function in R shows no Notes, Warnings or Errors, but I am not sure if that means that limma will install when installing my package from CRAN.

Currently I am declaring limma like this:

Suggests:

    limma



Can CRAN identify that limma is a Bioconductor-Package and will it Limma install, when installing my package from CRAN?

install.packages() doesn't install suggested packages by default: the
`dependencies` argument defaults to NA, which means c("Depends",
"Imports", "LinkingTo"), which doesn't include 'Suggests'.

What if you pass dependencies = TRUE? Given the fact that Bioconductor
is absent from getOption('repos') by default, the package will still
not be installed. BiocManager::install() is the supported way to
install packages from Bioconductor:
https://cran.r-project.org/package=BiocManager/vignettes/BiocManager.html#installing-bioconductor-cran-or-github-packages

I think that BiocManager::install('YOUR_PACKAGE', dependencies = TRUE)
will install both your package and limma. It's a bit hard to verify
because your package should live in a repository, but if you'd like to
be sure, spin up a drat <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=drat> repo
on a local server and add it to options(repos = ...) before trying to
install your package.

No, this is the right way to declare Bioconductor dependencies for CRAN
packages.

> Limma install, when installing my package from CRAN?

The CRAN website will detect the Bioconductor dependency and highlight
it with a different colour, making it a link to the Bioconductor
website. See, e.g., the BiocManager package and its reverse
dependencies: https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BiocManager

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Should 'methods' be in Imports?
Message-ID: <CAPhhD8noYxDO3S5uF1jjKJWVJ5vQvM+FNSRTvebAShf7Kj+T0A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello developers,

I am wondering if base packages whose functions are used in my package need
to be present in Imports in my DESCRIPTION. For example, if I use the
function abline(), which exists in the *graphics* package, do I need to
include *graphics* in Imports? Note I am not asking about whether I need to
import all or any function from the *graphics* package, that is, assume I
am using graphics::abline(), etc. I am solely asking about the DESCRIPTION
file, not the Namespace.

I ask because there seems to be some ambiguity about this. I received a
pull request from someone adding *methods* to my Imports after noticing I
didn't declare it when using a function from *methods* (accessed in my
package using ::). Looking on StackOverflow, there seems to be confusion
about this. The most relevant question I could find was this one
<https://stackoverflow.com/q/39439006/6348551>. The question was marked as
a duplicate despite the linked duplicate being separate from it (i.e.,
asking about the Namespace, not the DESCRIPTION). Similarly, the answer to
the question does not address the question, again referring to the
Namespace and making an irrelevant distinction between Depends and Imports.
Some of the comments reference a CRAN policy, and yet that policy does not
seem to be implemented since many packages (including all of mine) omit the
base packages from the DESCRIPTION.

So, is it optional to include these packages in the DESCRIPTION? I see some
packages do so and some don't. Is including these packages filling the
DESCRIPTION with unnecessary dependencies that are automatically satisfied,
or is it being helpfully explicit about the packages your package relies
on? Thanks.

Noah

I think the Writing R Extensions manual is pretty clear about this: 
yes, you should include "methods" in Imports or Depends if you are 
calling methods::<fn>.

You say "some packages do so and some don't".  Which ones don't?  It's 
helpful to be specific in your examples.

thank you.


I see you added biocView: below your suggested Dependencies. Is it necessary for CRAN to identify Bioconductor Dependencies and if so, should I add it below or above the suggested packages? Do I also need BiocManager among my Suggests?


Last question: How does CRAN work with Bioconductor Dependencies? Will CRAN accept limma as a dependency or will my submission be rejected?


Best regards,

Sergej

The Check-Function in R shows no Notes, Warnings or Errors, but I am not sure if that means that limma will install when installing my package from CRAN.

Currently I am declaring limma like this:

Suggests:

    limma



Can CRAN identify that limma is a Bioconductor-Package and will it Limma install, when installing my package from CRAN?

If some other package loads but doesn't attach pliman, and is missing 
EBImage, does it fail gracefully?  That's also important.  I'd test what 
happens if a user runs pliman::object_edge( ... ) .  (That function 
isn't in the CRAN version, just the Github version, so I haven't tried 
this.)

Hi Sergej,

I sincerely don't know if the position of biocView really matters (I'll try
it when preparing for the new CRAN release of pliman). I believe that
biocView will not allow you to put limma in the imports field and
automatically install it from Bioconductor, as you can see here in this
discussion <
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54411495/bioconductor-packages-not-installing-with-biocviews-specification-in-description
>

In my case, I had no errors when submitting pliman to CRAN using EBImage as
suggests (I haven't yet tried to use biocView: and EBImage in the Imports
section).

Best regards,
Olivoto

Thanks Duncan,
I'm in the way of a new CRAN submission and I will make sure to call
check_ebi() in the body of each function. This should ensure that the check
for EBImage will be called even with pliman::object_edge( ... ), for
example.

Best regards,
Olivoto

It's not explicitly spelled out in the CRAN policy
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html>, but
Bioconductor and CRAN are the "mainstream repositories" for the
purposes of the following rule:

>> Packages on which a CRAN package depends should be available from a
>> mainstream repository

(Even non-mainstream repositories are allowed for optional dependencies
if you follow a few additional rules.)

Here's an example of a CRAN package with a strong dependency on a
Bioconductor package: <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RTIGER>. You
can see the extra instructions for installing the Bioconductor
dependencies in its README.

Thank you for your input. *broom*, *mlogit*, *twang*, and *Hmisc*
are examples of major packages that import functions from *stats*, *utils*,
*graphics*, or other base packages but don't include them in the
DESCRIPTION. All of my packages (*cobalt*, *WeightIt*, *MatchIt*) do too,
and I have never had a message from CRAN about it. (None of these are
specifically about *methods*, but as a base package I assume it should work
the same as these others.)

broom doesn't mention stats in DESCRIPTION, but does import from it in 
the NAMESPACE. (I haven't checked the rest of your list.)  I'm a little 
surprised by that, but it's understandable:  the NAMESPACE does declare 
that stats is needed.  WRE says this about Imports:

"Namespaces accessed by the ?::? and ?:::? operators must be listed 
here, or in ?Suggests? or ?Enhances? (see below). Ideally this field 
will include all the standard packages that are used, and it is 
important to include S4-using packages."

So the use of Imports for "standard packages" that are used in NAMESPACE 
appears to be optional but recommended.

However, my understanding was that you were talking about using things 
like graphics::abline without importing any graphics functions via the 
NAMESPACE; in that case, the manual is very explicit that you would need 
to put graphics in Imports.  That doesn't mean "R CMD check" will 
complain if you don't, but it does mean that it might start doing so if 
it doesn't already.

Do you know of any examples of packages that use things like 
graphics::abline without mentioning graphics in either the NAMESPACE or 
DESCRIPTION file?

Here's a comment from the part of R CMD check that checks for NAMESPACE
dependencies unstated in DESCRIPTION:

>> Not clear whether we want to require *all* namespace package

>> non-base packages.  Do the latter for time being ...

So the answer is maybe. Personally, I opt for listing even the base
packages explicitly, but it's a choice. Duncan's quote from WRE hints
that this may be enforced in the future.

I do find it a bit strange that not listing methods as a dependency in
DESCRIPTION doesn't lead to complaints from R CMD check, because it
does seem that the code excludes methods (and stats4) from the list of
packages that are currently okay not to declare in DESCRIPTION.

I would not follow the instructions in RTIGER?s README for installing Bioconductor packages.

BiocManager::install(?RTIGER?) would install both CRAN and Bioconductor dependencies of RTIGER, and would be my preferred instruction in a README or INSTALL file. A complete instruction might be to install your package as if it were on Bioconductor ?

If (!requireNamepace(?BiocManager?, quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages(?BiocManager?)
BiocManager::install(?<your package>?)

It does not make sense to me to have instructions in .onAttach / .onLoad or in each function for the user to install a ?Suggests:? package, when actually the package is required for use and belongs in Imports: or perhaps Depends:.

The instruction to use ?version = ?3.14?? of Bioconductor in the RTIGER document is not universally correct, since different Bioconductor versions are tied to specific R versions (see https://bioconductor.org/about/release-announcements/ ). On one version of R I am currently using, I get

> BiocManager::install(version = "3.14")
Error: Bioconductor version '3.14' requires R version '4.1'; use
  `BiocManager::install(version = '3.17')` with R version 4.3; see
  https://bioconductor.org/install

The instruction to install a vector of Bioconductor packages is also unnecessary for Bioconductor packages in the Imports: or Depends: field of <your package>, or if one were to pass the argument `dependencies = TRUE` to either BiocManager::install() or install.packages() (to get the Suggests: packages of <your package> to be installed, as well as Depends:, Imports: and LinkingTo:).

Briefly, installation requires R to know the correct repositories. The command

BiocManager::repositories()

Returns a vector of Bioconductor and CRAN repositories relevant to your version of R. If one is averse to using BiocManager::install(?RTIGER?), a reasonable alternative, though still requiring that the BiocManager package is installed, is

install.packages(?RTIGER?, repos = BiocManager::repositories())

Base R also provides a mechanism for specifying Bioconductor repositories, via `setRepositories()` called before install.packages(). However, this is not recommended because, as can be seen on the web page mentioned above, there are two versions of Bioconductor for each version of R ? one always gets the ?old? Bioconductor version, even when a newer version is available.

Thank you both for your responses. Based on Ivan's dig into the comments,
it seems there is ambiguity, even by the CRAN team. Still, it looks like it
would be preferable to (and would not cause any harm to) include the base
packages in DESCRIPTION if they are used at all in a package, whether by ::
or imported from in the Namespace. I'll update my packages accordingly.

I was wondering how CRAN will handle Limma when running the automatic check.


I am worried that my package will be rejected if Limma won?t install from Bioconductor on a clean version of R. Leading to an Error and Note during the check.


I am using Limma only for an example in my functions description, not inside my actual function.


How would CRAN?s System handle that when checking my package for submission?


with regards,


Sergej

If you have it in the Suggests list you should have written your code to 
work (i.e. not trigger an error) whether it is installed or not, so you 
shouldn't worry about it.

fit1 = limma::lmFit(X, design)
fit = limma::eBayes(fit1)

The R CMD Check returns no Errors or Notes if Limma is pre-installed. If limma is not pre-installed I get an error, reminding me that Limma is not available.


Thats the source of my worries. Will the same error appear when CRAN checks the examples of my package? Or should I not be worried?


With regards,


Sergej

If you have it in the Suggests list you should have written your code to
work (i.e. not trigger an error) whether it is installed or not, so you
shouldn't worry about it.

Yes, part of CRAN checks is running your package without the packages
listed under Suggests:
https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/noSuggests/README.txt [*]

See WRE 1.1.3.1 for the official guidance on how to handle optional
dependencies that might not be installed:
https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Suggested-packages

In short, your code should check the return value of
requireNamespace('limma', quietly = TRUE) before trying to run code
from it. Your code can (and probably should) raise an error if asked to
do something using limma when it's not available, but then in your
tests/vignettes/examples you should check whether limma is available
before trying to run that code.

Thanks.


I would like to ask, if I need to add something to the DESCRIPTION-file when declaring Bioconductor dependencies for CRAn Submission.


Right now I only listed limma under "suggests".


I asked online and get conflicting answers. Some recommend adding biocViews: above suggests and some recommend adding

Remotes: bioc::limma


Others add Biocmanager to the suggests file in Addition to limma.


Is that necessary? What should I add to my Description File to make sure that limma gets installed from Bioconductor when needed?

Strictly speaking, no. Once you list limma under Suggests, it's
possible and proper to install your package using
BiocManager::install('YOUR_PACKAGE', dependencies = TRUE) and have
limma installed too, as Martin Morgan said above in the thread.

> Some recommend adding biocViews:

This field is required on Bioconductor, not CRAN:
https://contributions.bioconductor.org/description.html?q=biocViews#description-biocviews

> some recommend adding Remotes: bioc::limma

Not a standard R/CRAN field, only used by the remotes package:
https://remotes.r-lib.org/articles/dependencies.html

> Others add Biocmanager to the suggests file

I suppose it could help a user who doesn't initially know to use
BiocManager in order to install your package, and could also be used to
install limma on behalf of your users (with their permission!), but
it's additional work, may be hard to get right (see the CRAN policy
about installing packages and touching user files), and is not required
at all.

> What should I add to my Description File to make sure that limma gets
> installed from Bioconductor when needed?

See Martin Morgan's e-mail above in the thread. In short, tell your
users to install your package using BiocManager::install(...,
dependencies = TRUE) if they want limma to work. They are still free to
install.packages() if they don't want limma or can set things up
themselves.

Move limma to Imports (better) or Depends (may be worse)
if you want limma to be always available, at the cost of always
requiring Bioconductor to be set up to have your package installed.
There are other ways besides BiocManager::install(), but they all
depend on the user having set up Bioconductor repos in their R session
somehow, be it BiocManager::repositories() or setRepositories().

Thanks,


I thought about changing it to "Imports", but will it cause any issues when CRAN runs checks on my package and limma isn?t available on CRAN?

That's a problem, and will cause your package to be rejected.  It should 
not raise an error during the tests when a suggested package is missing. 
Ivan gave you good advice on how to fix this.

I'd recommend testing your package a few times on Winbuilder and fixing 
things until you get clean results.  That won't guarantee acceptance on 
CRAN; new packages get a manual inspection as well, and they'll often 
find some problem that the automatic tests don't find, e.g. stylistic 
issues in the Description field of the DESCRIPTION file.  Here's a note 
I received recently when I submitted a new package (RmdConcord):

----------------
The Description field is intended to be a (one paragraph) description of
what the package does and why it may be useful. Please add more details
about the package functionality and implemented methods in your
Description text.

Please always write package names, software names and API (application
programming interface) names in single quotes in title and description.
e.g: --> 'R Markdown'
Please note that package names are case sensitive.

Please do not start the description with "This package", "Functions
for", package name, title or similar.

No, BioC is a mainstream repository.

Really.Whats a problem i have when all dependencies arent prei installed. I thought the problem would be solved once my package is available on CRAN.


Here is a recent question I had regarding the same issue:


I am currently working on a r-package. I would like to submit my r package to CRAN, but I have a question regarding dependency installations on CRAN.

I have almost finished my package, added the required dependencies to the NAMESPACE and DESCRIPTION files as Imports, and get no errors or warnings

when running the check in Rstudio. The package runs on the pc, where I?ve built the package, but when I install the package on a pc, where the dependencies

are not preinstalled, I get the following error:

ERROR:

dependencies 'depth', 'geometry' are not available for package 'packagename'
* removing 'C:/Users/156932/AppData/Local/Programs/R/R-4.2.1/library/packagename'
Warning in install.packages : installation of package ?packagename? had non-zero exit status


The problem is that a local installation of my package (via USB-stick for example) can?t install the dependencies from CRAN.

The package works perfectly fine, if the dependencies are preinstalled.

Now I don?t want to submit my package to CRAN if the end user gets the same error message when installing my package.

Question: After I submit my package to CRAN, will CRAN install dependencies automatically (via "install.packages()"), resolving the issue I have right now?

Or do I have to modify the R-package or the Description-file to make sure my Package can install dependencies?

I provided the dependencies to the NAMESPACE-file as @ImportFrom via the devtools::document()-function. I added the dependencies to the DESCRIPTION-file via usethis::use_package("x",type="Imports"). The Description looks like this:

License: GPL (>= 3)
Encoding: UTF-8
LazyData: true
RoxygenNote: 7.2.3
Imports:
    depth,
    geometry,
    graphics,
    grDevices,
    MASS,
    mvtnorm,
    nlme,
    rgl,
    stats



So I thought all dependencies would install automatically from CRAN? Is that not the case?

That's a problem, and will cause your package to be rejected.  It should
not raise an error during the tests when a suggested package is missing.
Ivan gave you good advice on how to fix this.

I'd recommend testing your package a few times on Winbuilder and fixing
things until you get clean results.  That won't guarantee acceptance on
CRAN; new packages get a manual inspection as well, and they'll often
find some problem that the automatic tests don't find, e.g. stylistic
issues in the Description field of the DESCRIPTION file.  Here's a note
I received recently when I submitted a new package (RmdConcord):

----------------
The Description field is intended to be a (one paragraph) description of
what the package does and why it may be useful. Please add more details
about the package functionality and implemented methods in your
Description text.

Please always write package names, software names and API (application
programming interface) names in single quotes in title and description.
e.g: --> 'R Markdown'
Please note that package names are case sensitive.

Please do not start the description with "This package", "Functions
for", package name, title or similar.

The user should set the CRAN+BioC via setRepositories() and then run 
install.packages() will install all dependencies automatically.
Of course, if you install from a local repository without the required 
packages or from a USB drive, R cannot resolve dependencies.

Uwe Ligges

This is a similar, but different problem. It is indeed solved by having
your package with its dependencies in a repository.

> So I thought all dependencies would install automatically from CRAN?

The user is allowed to install your package with dependencies = NA
(which means not installing packages listed under Suggests). The
Depends, Imports and LinkingTo will be installed, but not Suggests. The
user will have to pass dependencies = TRUE in order to install the
packages listed under Suggests.

Your package is required to work (in particular, run the examples and
vignettes and pass the tests without errors) without having the
suggested packages installed:
<https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Suggested-packages>.
You can check whether limma can be loaded and raise an error otherwise,
but your tests, examples and vignettes shouldn't raise errors or
otherwise crash. This is checked by CRAN here:
https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/noSuggests/README.txt

If your package can't be meaningfully used without limma, do list it as
a strong dependency.

Ivan

You keep repeating basically the same questions, and appear to be 
ignoring the advice you've received.  That's partly understandable, 
because some of it (what you find in places like StackOverflow) is 
wrong, but I think you should trust what I said, and what Ivan, Martin 
and Uwe said.  Uwe is an authority on CRAN, Martin is an authority on 
BioConductor, and Ivan and I are experienced R users.

I will implement the changes you recommended into my package. Thank you for your help.


I wasn?t ignoring your advice, I am just confused because other sources like Stackoverflow gave me contradicting information and I wanted to be sure.


I will write if I encounter other problems which fit that issue.

Thank you for your help.


Regards,

Sergej

You keep repeating basically the same questions, and appear to be
ignoring the advice you've received.  That's partly understandable,
because some of it (what you find in places like StackOverflow) is
wrong, but I think you should trust what I said, and what Ivan, Martin
and Uwe said.  Uwe is an authority on CRAN, Martin is an authority on
BioConductor, and Ivan and I are experienced R users.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Screen reader help request
Message-ID: <745a3154-4cf1-36c1-6b44-c6ba7d146749@gmail.com>

I received a request a few days ago to add alt text to the plots in the 
HTML vignettes for the rgl package.

That was easy to do, and I did it, but realized most of the graphics 
that rgl produces are not in <img> format, they are WebGL canvases, and 
those don't support the same method of adding alternate text.  Online 
I've seen a variety of suggestions about how to do it for <canvas> 
elements, and have implemented one of them.

Could I ask someone who is familiar with one or more screen readers to 
test whether the method that I used works?  A sample web page produced 
with the new code is here:

   https://dmurdoch.github.io/rgl/dev/articles/rgl.html

The very first graphic is a plot of the iris data, and it should have 
alt text reading "rglwidget in chunk unnamed-chunk-1".

That was default text generated without user input, users could put 
whatever they wanted there instead.

Some related questions:

  - Could you suggest better default text to use?

  - Could you suggest good custom text for this particular graphic?

  - The text is inserted when some Javascript has run to initialize the 
page, so if the Javascript fails, there'll be no alt text.  Is that a 
reasonable limitation?

Packages can only be installed from the repositories listed and only CRAN is the default so only CRAN package are guaranteed to work. I'd like to add that the issue below is exactly why, personally, I would not recommend using Bioconductor package as strong dependency (imports/depends), because that makes the package unusable for most users, as it cannot be installed (without extra steps they don't know about) since the dependency doesn't exist on CRAN.

If your users are already Bioconductor users by the virtue of the package application then they already know so it's fine, but then you are probably better off to have your package on Bioconductor as part of the ecosystem which is much more streamlined and coordinated.

If it is only suggested (weak dependency) for some optional functionality, then your package will work even if the dependency is not installed so all is well. And if the optional Bioconductor functionality is used you can direct the user to instructions explaining that Bioconductor is required for that - but the package has to do that, it is not anything automatic in R.

Cheers,
Simon

Hello Duncan,

I guess a few people might expect me to contribute to your request. First I'll assure you that two graphics do have an alt tag which my screen reader is telling me about, so in a sense that is success. I did not check with multiple screen readers or different browsers because I would only find fault if I used inferior software; I expect success with JAWS or NVDA to represent the other and likewise for browsers. These two successes are the lattice and base graphics relating to the volcano data. Others are not showing to my screen reader (JAWS) and browser (Chrome) on my OS (Windows). I note that these are inserted using <img> though.

What should appear in an alt tag is an area of much debate though, and the attitude towards their creation differs widely. I believe that the context is the primary driver for what should be communicated. In your context, where you are obviously writing about the package (in general) and comparison of lattice v base graphics (where I do see the alt tags), it is the main text that should be communicating with your audience. You know what you are writing and why. If you do not write about the differences then you leave it up to chance that your (mostly visually-dependent) audience sees the differences that matter to you and your efforts as an author/developer. Complementing that information intended for the whole audience with a sensible alt tag on the graphics for the blind part of your audience, would be fundamentally different to what you might need to offer for the same graphics in another context, say an analysis feeding into a business report for example. In your context, the blind person needs to know that the graphic does appear, and that the graphic has a unique (enough) label to make it obvious which graphic appeared where. We do not need a full description of every last detail of each graphic, although in other contexts, that is exactly what we need.

Generating alt tag text automatically (no human interaction) is going to deliver on the technical aspects, without the analytic outcomes, although our recent efforts with the BrailleR package are trying to offer more and more factual information that could help with the analysis of the data. Our main aim is to assure the blind producer of a graphic that it does actually exist and what (roughly) it shows; it would not be great text for an alt tag in most circumstances. I've done some limited testing with AI solutions but haven't yet been overwhelmed by positive experiences.

Anyone using an R markdown workflow can add alt text using the fig.alt option in the header of their chunks. Without that, the fig.cap option is used, and if neither is used, the screen reader user is victim to their personal settings. (We choose whether to be told about unlabelled graphics which used to be helpful for ignoring advertising.) I don't put unique alt tags in all of my work because I just need to convey that the graphic is there, but I do make sure there is a default bit of text that saves blind users with the wrong settings from their decisions. 


An author wishing to support blind consumers of their efforts, could spend lots of time working out what to write, and never get it perfectly correct because the desires of those consumers are not homogeneous. I advise people to use an alt tag, but to make sure it does not duplicate what is already said in the main text of their document. Authors already do this when thinking about the right caption for their figures, but it is easy to see how varied that can be. At least the target audience of captions is well known to the author given the author is part of that population; in contrast, most authors are not blind and may over or under-estimate the needs of the blind readers of their work. Before doing everything an individual requests, please make sure that what is being sought is in keeping with what you are hoping to communicate.

I despair at the retrospective creation of alt tags, especially if applied to living documents. Creation of alt tags is simple for anyone using regular markdown based insertion of their graphics because the ![]() construct embraces them in the []. Authors using a LaTeX workflow must load an additional package and add an optional argument to their \includegraphics{} commands. MS Word users can label their graphics anytime but of late there is an increased use of an automated alt tag creation for them (and messages in Outlook too for that matter). I am loathed to fully describe the LaTeX pipeline unless the author is also committed to producing their output in HTML as I have utter contempt for the pdf (or post script) that is the default for most authors using any TeX workflows.

Post hoc editing of html is perhaps the worst possible action I observe. This process has separated the creator of the content from the creator of the access for blind people, and is heavily reliant on the skill set of the accessibility "expert". Such editing is common in university settings where the Disability Support Service is responsible for the accessibility. If I was an undergraduate today, I'd be camping outside the doors of my teaching staff to get the alt tags inserted. I spent plenty of time back then, sitting in corridors waiting my turn, but so many of the access challenges of the dead-tree era are thankfully behind us.


I'm curious though that a blind person is going to benefit much from your package given so much of what I read relies on using a mouse, or having the ability to imagine the 3d data projected into an inherently 2d page/screen/image. In turn, that inaccessibility might heavily influence my effort to provide comprehensive alt tags.

I'd be more than happy to continue this conversation, and to do so on list because I think there are so many opportunities on offer today for people to embrace; many of which will not create piles of extra work.

thank,


I was wondering if my idea regarding the implementation is correct.


I took the idea from Tiago Olivoto and wrote an additional function that checks if limma is installed.


Here is a mockup based on Tiago?s package:


check_limma<- function(){
  if(!requireNamespace("limma", quietly = TRUE)) {
    if(interactive() == TRUE){
      inst <-
        switch(menu(c("Yes", "No"), title = "Package {limma} required but not installed.\nDo you want to install it now?"),
               "yes", "no")
      if(inst == "yes"){
        if(!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
          install.packages("BiocManager", quiet = TRUE)
        }
        BiocManager::install("limma",
                             update = FALSE,
                             ask = FALSE,
                             quiet = TRUE)
      } else{
        message("To run this example}, first install {limma} following the directions at 'https://bioconductor.org/packages/limma'")
      }
    }
  }
}

I would add the check in my example before limma functions are used.


### Differential expression analysis with limma

check_limma()
group = gl(2, n)
design = model.matrix(~ group)
fit1 = limma::lmFit(X, design)
fit = limma::eBayes(fit1)

I tried running the R CMD Check but I keep getting 1 error and note.
Is the implementation incorrect?

regards, Sergej

Betreff: Re: [R-pkg-devel] How to declare Bioconductor Dependencies in the Description File of my R Package

Packages can only be installed from the repositories listed and only CRAN is the default so only CRAN package are guaranteed to work. I'd like to add that the issue below is exactly why, personally, I would not recommend using Bioconductor package as strong dependency (imports/depends), because that makes the package unusable for most users, as it cannot be installed (without extra steps they don't know about) since the dependency doesn't exist on CRAN.

If your users are already Bioconductor users by the virtue of the package application then they already know so it's fine, but then you are probably better off to have your package on Bioconductor as part of the ecosystem which is much more streamlined and coordinated.

If it is only suggested (weak dependency) for some optional functionality, then your package will work even if the dependency is not installed so all is well. And if the optional Bioconductor functionality is used you can direct the user to instructions explaining that Bioconductor is required for that - but the package has to do that, it is not anything automatic in R.

Cheers,
Simon

Thanks very much for your response.

The two images where the tags showed up are regular figures, using 
lattice and base graphics.  There are also a lot of rgl figures, which 
have HTML code like this in the source .html file:

   <div id="rgl61108" style="width:480px;height:296.662546353523px;" 
class="rglWebGL html-widget "></div>

(Looks like I should think about rounding the height value!)

All the interesting stuff (including the alt tags) is added within the 
div by Javascript that runs after the page is loaded.  The fact that it 
didn't show up in your reader indicates to me that either it needs to be 
there before the Javascript runs, or that I put the text in the wrong 
place.  I'll try a few variations on the code and hopefully find 
something that works.

Your comments about the content of the tags was also very helpful.  I am 
imagining that there are at least two groups of readers who might make 
use of them:

   - readers who would skip over the graphics completely, but who would 
be helped by knowing what they missed.

   - readers who can get information from the graphics but only with an 
effort, so they would want to know where to apply that effort.

For the document I posted, there might not be very many people in either 
group, but I'm hoping to make the package useful to others, who would be 
writing documents with different audiences.

Authors already do this when thinking about the right caption for their figures, but it is easy to see how varied that can be. At least the target audience of captions is well known to the author given the author is part of that population; in contrast, most authors are not blind and may over or under-estimate the needs of the blind readers of their work.

Creation of alt tags is simple for anyone using regular markdown based insertion of their graphics because the ![]() construct embraces them in the []. Authors using a LaTeX workflow must load an additional package and add an optional argument to their \includegraphics{} commands. MS Word users can label their graphics anytime but of late there is an increased use of an automated alt tag creation for them (and messages in Outlook too for that matter). I am loathed to fully describe the LaTeX pipeline unless the author is also committed to producing their output in HTML as I have utter contempt for the pdf (or post script) that is the default for most authors using any TeX workflows.

This process has separated the creator of the content from the creator of the access for blind people, and is heavily reliant on the skill set of the accessibility "expert".

If I was an undergraduate today, I'd be camping outside the doors of my teaching staff to get the alt tags inserted.

Hello again Duncan,

I could see the two successes were <img> ... </img> creations and that the others weren't.

I worry though that in searching for a solution, you need to end up with something that is as simple for authors as what little effort is needed for fig.alt; having looked at the HTML, I'd rather know what is happening at the Rmd file stage and how anything created there gets passed on.

IMO:  Your reflections on the content of the tags is bang on target. In a perfect world, this is where authors' efforts should be, not on the technical "how do I get that done" aspects.

I suspect that fixing the toolkit is necessary. A demonstration that a problem can be solved is often a first step in creating access. Furthermore, this is not a problem unique to your single document. Other authors will want to use the same tools which you are demonstrating.

Alt tags are a perfect demonstration of access that does not impinge on everyone who doesn't need that feature. Use of fig.cap (initially) and latterly fig.alt to provide the access was done at the toolkit level, and it cannot get any easier for authors. That maximises the chances that authors do then turn to the content of the tags.

I'm happy to assist on projects that lead to positive improvements under the hood that ultimately create access without authors having to become experts in providing access.

We might take the testing off list, but keep the discussion of access on list.

Jonathan

I would use conditional returns to make the code more readable (see below) and then run the examples conditionally.

check_limma <- function() # Returns TRUE if available, FALSE otherwise
{
  if(requireNamespace("limma", quietly=TRUE)) return(TRUE)
  if(!interactive()) return(FALSE)
  inst <- menu(c("Yes", "No"), title="Package {limma} required but not installed.\nDo you want to install it now?")
  if(inst != 1)
    {
    message("To run this example, first install {limma} following the directions at 'https://bioconductor.org/packages/limma'")
    return(FALSE)
    }
  # the following could be wrapped in try and conditionally return TRUE / FALSE
  if(!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly=TRUE)) install.packages("BiocManager", quiet=TRUE)
  BiocManager::install("limma", update=FALSE, ask=FALSE, quiet=TRUE)
  return(TRUE)
}

# In the examples:
if(check_limma()){
group = gl(2, n)
design = model.matrix(~ group)
fit1 = limma::lmFit(X, design)
fit = limma::eBayes(fit1)
}

thank,


I was wondering if my idea regarding the implementation is correct.


I took the idea from Tiago Olivoto and wrote an additional function that checks if limma is installed.


Here is a mockup based on Tiago?s package:


check_limma<- function(){
  if(!requireNamespace("limma", quietly = TRUE)) {
    if(interactive() == TRUE){
      inst <-
        switch(menu(c("Yes", "No"), title = "Package {limma} required but not installed.\nDo you want to install it now?"),
               "yes", "no")
      if(inst == "yes"){
        if(!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
          install.packages("BiocManager", quiet = TRUE)
        }
        BiocManager::install("limma",
                             update = FALSE,
                             ask = FALSE,
                             quiet = TRUE)
      } else{
        message("To run this example}, first install {limma} following the directions at 'https://bioconductor.org/packages/limma'")
      }
    }
  }
}

I would add the check in my example before limma functions are used.


### Differential expression analysis with limma

check_limma()
group = gl(2, n)
design = model.matrix(~ group)
fit1 = limma::lmFit(X, design)
fit = limma::eBayes(fit1)

I tried running the R CMD Check but I keep getting 1 error and note.
Is the implementation incorrect?

Packages can only be installed from the repositories listed and only CRAN is the default so only CRAN package are guaranteed to work. I'd like to add that the issue below is exactly why, personally, I would not recommend using Bioconductor package as strong dependency (imports/depends), because that makes the package unusable for most users, as it cannot be installed (without extra steps they don't know about) since the dependency doesn't exist on CRAN.

If your users are already Bioconductor users by the virtue of the package application then they already know so it's fine, but then you are probably better off to have your package on Bioconductor as part of the ecosystem which is much more streamlined and coordinated.

If it is only suggested (weak dependency) for some optional functionality, then your package will work even if the dependency is not installed so all is well. And if the optional Bioconductor functionality is used you can direct the user to instructions explaining that Bioconductor is required for that - but the package has to do that, it is not anything automatic in R.

Cheers,
Simon

I've made another attempt at this now.  I'm a bit more hopeful about 
this one, but still not sure.

In the new code, I write the text in a <p> element which is hidden, and 
use aria-labelledby to say that both the <div> and the <canvas> are 
labelled by that text.

I am quite hopeful that the text will be detected by a screen reader 
now.  You may hear it twice; if so, I have a couple of ideas how to fix 
that.

I've also thought about what you said about the default text, and have 
changed it slightly.  Now the first plot in the page

   https://dmurdoch.github.io/rgl/dev/articles/rgl.html

will have alt text "Rotatable plot with label unnamed-chunk-1". 
Obviously customized text would be better, but I think this should be 
better than nothing.

For authors using this, the R Markdown optional fig.alt setting almost 
works.  It's fine if you only have one plot, but if you have multiple 
plots with different fig.alt settings rgl will only use the first one. 
I think a change in knitr is needed so that rgl can work out which one 
you really want.

The Shiny support is also a little deficient.  It would make sense in an 
interactive Shiny page to be able to change the alt text in response to 
user actions, but that's not possible yet.  If there are any Shiny 
experts reading this, I could use some help with that.

Duncan et al., I report success.

The promised text was attached to a graphic, and only appeared once. Not sure what the hidden text is about, or why it is needed. (?) so I went and edited the raw html (to make sure the alt text is only located in there) and my edit is plain to hear.

So there are not two audible versions and the one that matters is in the right place. I can tell the second graphic has a different style of alt text and that later graphics are separated by other code chunks that do not generate graphics (8, 9, and 10) N.B. I was skimming to look for graphics, not reading the associated text or code.

>From a user perspective, the graphics created using canvas are indistinguishable from those inserted using img. This is an example where success in access is unnoticeable to the end user and seldom gets acknowledge of effort as a consequence. I'll say thank you now on behalf of the blissfully unaware blind readers.

I'd like to know that the effort required by future authors is equal for all types of images. The failing of fig.alt to deliver on multiple images in a chunk is something to worry about in a different conversation. I'm watching this and other issues with respect to the development of quarto documents, but in order to test those, I  start with he Rmd performance as a reference point. I hadn't tested multiple plots yet, probably because I don't use them very often.

I can't address the Shiny issues. I can tell people though that there are access issues with some Shiny widgets. These were being investigated by another blind R user so I can check how that has progressed. I sense that his work is not yet complete.

Subject: Re: [R-pkg-devel] Screen reader help request

I've made another attempt at this now.  I'm a bit more hopeful about this one, but still not sure.

In the new code, I write the text in a <p> element which is hidden, and use aria-labelledby to say that both the <div> and the <canvas> are labelled by that text.

I am quite hopeful that the text will be detected by a screen reader now.  You may hear it twice; if so, I have a couple of ideas how to fix that.

I've also thought about what you said about the default text, and have changed it slightly.  Now the first plot in the page

   https://apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdmurdoch.github.io%2Frgl%2Fdev%2Farticles%2Frgl.html&data=05%7C01%7CA.J.Godfrey%40massey.ac.nz%7C8f0eb72383f74148cef008db27e01261%7C388728e1bbd0437898dcf8682e644300%7C1%7C0%7C638147615570986760%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=3B9Oapk8PCYTb62K1UBbvHg7DoxdMX3e9ZwRyXFg6CA%3D&reserved=0

will have alt text "Rotatable plot with label unnamed-chunk-1". 
Obviously customized text would be better, but I think this should be better than nothing.

For authors using this, the R Markdown optional fig.alt setting almost works.  It's fine if you only have one plot, but if you have multiple plots with different fig.alt settings rgl will only use the first one. 
I think a change in knitr is needed so that rgl can work out which one you really want.

The Shiny support is also a little deficient.  It would make sense in an interactive Shiny page to be able to change the alt text in response to user actions, but that's not possible yet.  If there are any Shiny experts reading this, I could use some help with that.

That's great news.  Thanks for your rapid testing!

Regarding quarto:  most of what I did for embedding rgl in R Markdown 
just worked in quarto:  it uses a very similar system for embedding 
graphics.  There were one or two issues which I believe have been fixed.

I think the next task is getting the multiple-figure situation sorted out.

I can tell the second graphic has a different style of alt text and that later graphics are separated by other code chunks that do not generate graphics (8, 9, and 10) N.B. I was skimming to look for graphics, not reading the associated text or code.

This is an example where success in access is unnoticeable to the end user and seldom gets acknowledge of effort as a consequence.

The failing of fig.alt to deliver on multiple images in a chunk is something to worry about in a different conversation. I'm watching this and other issues with respect to the development of quarto documents, but in order to test those, I  start with he Rmd performance as a reference point. I hadn't tested multiple plots yet, probably because I don't use them very often.

>>> I guess a few people might expect me to contribute to your request. First I'll assure you that two graphics do have an alt tag which my screen reader is telling me about, so in a sense that is success. I did not check with multiple screen readers or different browsers because I would only find fault if I used inferior software; I expect success with JAWS or NVDA to represent the other and likewise for browsers. These two successes are the lattice and base graphics relating to the volcano data. Others are not showing to my screen reader (JAWS) and browser (Chrome) on my OS (Windows). I note that these are inserted using <img> though.
>>>
>>> What should appear in an alt tag is an area of much debate though, and the attitude towards their creation differs widely. I believe that the context is the primary driver for what should be communicated. In your context, where you are obviously writing about the package (in general) and comparison of lattice v base graphics (where I do see the alt tags), it is the main text that should be communicating with your audience. You know what you are writing and why. If you do not write about the differences then you leave it up to chance that your (mostly visually-dependent) audience sees the differences that matter to you and your efforts as an author/developer. Complementing that information intended for the whole audience with a sensible alt tag on the graphics for the blind part of your audience, would be fundamentally different to what you might need to offer for the same graphics in another context, say an analysis feeding into a business report for example. In your context, the blind person needs to know that the graphic does appear, and that the graphic has a unique (enough) label to make it obvious which graphic appeared where. We do not need a full description of every last detail of each graphic, although in other contexts, that is exactly what we need.
>>>
>>> Generating alt tag text automatically (no human interaction) is going to deliver on the technical aspects, without the analytic outcomes, although our recent efforts with the BrailleR package are trying to offer more and more factual information that could help with the analysis of the data. Our main aim is to assure the blind producer of a graphic that it does actually exist and what (roughly) it shows; it would not be great text for an alt tag in most circumstances. I've done some limited testing with AI solutions but haven't yet been overwhelmed by positive experiences.
>>>
>>> Anyone using an R markdown workflow can add alt text using the fig.alt option in the header of their chunks. Without that, the fig.cap option is used, and if neither is used, the screen reader user is victim to their personal settings. (We choose whether to be told about unlabelled graphics which used to be helpful for ignoring advertising.) I don't put unique alt tags in all of my work because I just need to convey that the graphic is there, but I do make sure there is a default bit of text that saves blind users with the wrong settings from their decisions.
>>>
>>>
>>> An author wishing to support blind consumers of their efforts, could spend lots of time working out what to write, and never get it perfectly correct because the desires of those consumers are not homogeneous. I advise people to use an alt tag, but to make sure it does not duplicate what is already said in the main text of their document. Authors already do this when thinking about the right caption for their figures, but it is easy to see how varied that can be. At least the target audience of captions is well known to the author given the author is part of that population; in contrast, most authors are not blind and may over or under-estimate the needs of the blind readers of their work. Before doing everything an individual requests, please make sure that what is being sought is in keeping with what you are hoping to communicate.
>>>
>>> I despair at the retrospective creation of alt tags, especially if applied to living documents. Creation of alt tags is simple for anyone using regular markdown based insertion of their graphics because the ![]() construct embraces them in the []. Authors using a LaTeX workflow must load an additional package and add an optional argument to their \includegraphics{} commands. MS Word users can label their graphics anytime but of late there is an increased use of an automated alt tag creation for them (and messages in Outlook too for that matter). I am loathed to fully describe the LaTeX pipeline unless the author is also committed to producing their output in HTML as I have utter contempt for the pdf (or post script) that is the default for most authors using any TeX workflows.
>>>
>>> Post hoc editing of html is perhaps the worst possible action I observe. This process has separated the creator of the content from the creator of the access for blind people, and is heavily reliant on the skill set of the accessibility "expert". Such editing is common in university settings where the Disability Support Service is responsible for the accessibility. If I was an undergraduate today, I'd be camping outside the doors of my teaching staff to get the alt tags inserted. I spent plenty of time back then, sitting in corridors waiting my turn, but so many of the access challenges of the dead-tree era are thankfully behind us.
>>>
>>>
>>> I'm curious though that a blind person is going to benefit much from your package given so much of what I read relies on using a mouse, or having the ability to imagine the 3d data projected into an inherently 2d page/screen/image. In turn, that inaccessibility might heavily influence my effort to provide comprehensive alt tags.

I implemented Berrys function.


I works fine when limma is pre-installed.

When Limma is ?re-installed, I get the following Note:


"Package suggested but not available for checking: 'limma'".


Seems like the functions isnt installing limma.

Is there something I am missing? I added BiocManager and limma to the suggests and utils to Imports.

Sergej

I would use conditional returns to make the code more readable (see below) and then run the examples conditionally.

check_limma <- function() # Returns TRUE if available, FALSE otherwise
{
  if(requireNamespace("limma", quietly=TRUE)) return(TRUE)
  if(!interactive()) return(FALSE)
  inst <- menu(c("Yes", "No"), title="Package {limma} required but not installed.\nDo you want to install it now?")
  if(inst != 1)
    {
    message("To run this example, first install {limma} following the directions at 'https://bioconductor.org/packages/limma'")
    return(FALSE)
    }
  # the following could be wrapped in try and conditionally return TRUE / FALSE
  if(!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly=TRUE)) install.packages("BiocManager", quiet=TRUE)
  BiocManager::install("limma", update=FALSE, ask=FALSE, quiet=TRUE)
  return(TRUE)
}

# In the examples:
if(check_limma()){
group = gl(2, n)
design = model.matrix(~ group)
fit1 = limma::lmFit(X, design)
fit = limma::eBayes(fit1)
}

My 2 cents ?

thank,


I was wondering if my idea regarding the implementation is correct.


I took the idea from Tiago Olivoto and wrote an additional function that checks if limma is installed.


Here is a mockup based on Tiago?s package:


check_limma<- function(){
  if(!requireNamespace("limma", quietly = TRUE)) {
    if(interactive() == TRUE){
      inst <-
        switch(menu(c("Yes", "No"), title = "Package {limma} required but not installed.\nDo you want to install it now?"),
               "yes", "no")
      if(inst == "yes"){
        if(!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
          install.packages("BiocManager", quiet = TRUE)
        }
        BiocManager::install("limma",
                             update = FALSE,
                             ask = FALSE,
                             quiet = TRUE)
      } else{
        message("To run this example}, first install {limma} following the directions at 'https://bioconductor.org/packages/limma'")
      }
    }
  }
}

I would add the check in my example before limma functions are used.


### Differential expression analysis with limma

check_limma()
group = gl(2, n)
design = model.matrix(~ group)
fit1 = limma::lmFit(X, design)
fit = limma::eBayes(fit1)

I tried running the R CMD Check but I keep getting 1 error and note.
Is the implementation incorrect?

regards, Sergej

Packages can only be installed from the repositories listed and only CRAN is the default so only CRAN package are guaranteed to work. I'd like to add that the issue below is exactly why, personally, I would not recommend using Bioconductor package as strong dependency (imports/depends), because that makes the package unusable for most users, as it cannot be installed (without extra steps they don't know about) since the dependency doesn't exist on CRAN.

If your users are already Bioconductor users by the virtue of the package application then they already know so it's fine, but then you are probably better off to have your package on Bioconductor as part of the ecosystem which is much more streamlined and coordinated.

If it is only suggested (weak dependency) for some optional functionality, then your package will work even if the dependency is not installed so all is well. And if the optional Bioconductor functionality is used you can direct the user to instructions explaining that Bioconductor is required for that - but the package has to do that, it is not anything automatic in R.

Cheers,
Simon

I implemented a function to check if limma is available as suggested by Berry and Tiago.

It works fine when limma is pre-installed.
When Limma is not pre-installed, I get the following Note:

"Package suggested but not available for checking: 'limma'".

Seems like the functions isn't installing limma.
Is there something I am missing? I added BiocManager and limma to the suggests and utils to Imports.

check_limma <- function() # Returns TRUE if available, FALSE otherwise
{
  if(requireNamespace("limma", quietly=TRUE)) return(TRUE)
  if(!interactive()) return(FALSE)
  inst <- menu(c("Yes", "No"), title="Package {limma} required but not installed.\nDo you want to install it now?")
  if(inst != 1)

    message("To run this example, first install {limma} following the directions at 'https://bioconductor.org/packages/limma'")
    return(FALSE)
  }
  # the following could be wrapped in try and conditionally return TRUE / FALSE
  if(!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly=TRUE)) install.packages("BiocManager", quiet=TRUE)
  BiocManager::install("limma", update=FALSE, ask=FALSE, quiet=TRUE)
  return(TRUE)
}

The check also never brings up the menu to ask me, if limma should be installed. Is that normal or should I change something about the
function.

Sergej

Hi,
My package pliman depends on EBImage which is in Bioconductor. I have created a function check_ebi() <https://github.com/TiagoOlivoto/pliman/blob/e6efc4b6a2396600939e308c235aeb9ab47af375/R/utilities.R#L534> that is called in .onAttach() <https://github.com/TiagoOlivoto/pliman/blob/master/R/zzz.R#L36>  and checks if EBImage is installed. If not, the function asks the user to install it. Both EBImage and BiocManager are listed as suggests <https://github.com/TiagoOlivoto/pliman/blob/master/DESCRIPTION#L22>

I believe that this could be a possible solution
Best regards,
Olivoto

I am currently building a package which uses the "limma"-package as a dependency.

Do I need to declare Bioconductor-dependencies such as Limma differently in the Description-File of my Package?

The Check-Function in R shows no Notes, Warnings or Errors, but I am not sure if that means that limma will install when installing my package from CRAN.

Currently I am declaring limma like this:

Suggests:

    limma



Can CRAN identify that limma is a Bioconductor-Package and will it Limma install, when installing my package from CRAN?

No, this is exactly how it's supposed to behave under R CMD check. The
CRAN policy forbids packages to install other packages ("Packages
should not write in the user?s home filespace <...> nor anywhere else
on the file system") except when the user gives permission to do so
("Limited exceptions may be allowed in interactive sessions if the
package obtains confirmation from the user").

Under R CMD check, interactive() is FALSE because there is no user to
ask permission from, so the function correctly decides not to install
the package. The resulting NOTE is the expected result here. The
important part is that your example doesn't crash because it's unable
to load the limma namespace.

Ivan

It appears that you have some uses of .Call() where you are passing a 
character variable as the first argument, instead of registering the 
entry point and passing the variable containing the registration 
information.

 From your second link, it looks like Rcpp has some special way to 
handle entry point registration.  I'm not familiar with that, I use the 
basic way described in Writing R Extensions, section 5.4 "Registering 
native routines".

Correct. And to make the case worse, the package then calls (on line 130 of
coranking_main.cpp) the very 'R_forceSymbols(info, TRUE);' that is now
telling it about the error of using _quoted_ ("text") rather than symbol
references. Just removing line 130 may work.

Rcpp checks if a useDynLib("nameofpackage") has `, .registration=TRUE)` and
if so, creates glue code with symbols (ie what Guido desires here) instead of
text variables (as was common a long time ago).

That was the case of package 'sf' which I helped yesterday; all it took there
was to ensure it used `useDynLib("sf", .registration=TRUE)` and to re-create
the generated RcppExports.R via Rcpp's own `compileAttributes()` function (as
I did in PR that Edzer merged hours later).

But none of this helps Guido as his package prefers to do it all by hand --
which is perfectly fine and valid, of course -- but a little bit more work.

thanks,


but I thought Notes will also cause rejection when submitting a package to CRAN. Won?t that be a problem?

My package isn?t new, so it will most likely only be checked by CRAN?s automatic system.

No, this is exactly how it's supposed to behave under R CMD check. The
CRAN policy forbids packages to install other packages ("Packages
should not write in the user?s home filespace <...> nor anywhere else
on the file system") except when the user gives permission to do so
("Limited exceptions may be allowed in interactive sessions if the
package obtains confirmation from the user").

Under R CMD check, interactive() is FALSE because there is no user to
ask permission from, so the function correctly decides not to install
the package. The resulting NOTE is the expected result here. The
important part is that your example doesn't crash because it's unable
to load the limma namespace.

True, a NOTE during an automatic check may cause a rejection, but you
won't get this NOTE there. Automatic CRAN pre-tests are done with a
full package set: anything from CRAN and BioConductor that runs on a
given operating system can be loaded.

(This differentiates CRAN from, say, PyPI or NPM: the two latter
ecosystems are much larger and are expected to handle conflicting
dependency requirements. CRAN is small enough to be able to enforce the
rule that every package must play well with the latest version of
everything else.)

There's an additional CRAN check called noSuggests
<https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/noSuggests/README.txt>. You will
get a NOTE there, but it's expected and won't count against you. The
only way avoid this NOTE there is to not have any packages in Suggests:
(or Enhances:).

Sure. I think your main issue was that you were "almost there" but didn't
actually go through calling as symbols, and the very recent change of having
R_forceSymbols() then error caught you out.

But all good now, and that's why we have checks and balances.

(One micro nit for something else I noticed: you have a nice pkgdown site,
but not linked to it anywhere.)

Cheers, Dirk

Dear all,

I maintain the RISCA package and I have the following new issue when I submit the novel version 1.0.4 on the CRAN:

***
CRAN teams' auto-check service
Flavor: r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-gcc, r-devel-windows-x86_64
Check: CRAN incoming feasibility, Result: Note_to_CRAN_maintainers
 Maintainer: 'Yohann Foucher <Yohann.Foucher at univ-poitiers.fr <mailto:Yohann.Foucher at univ-poitiers.fr>>'

Flavor: r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-gcc, r-devel-windows-x86_64
Check: Rd \usage sections, Result: NOTE
 S3 methods shown with full name in documentation object 'nnet.time':
   'nnet.time'

 The \usage entries for S3 methods should use the \method markup and not
 their full name.
 See chapter 'Writing R documentation files' in the 'Writing R
 Extensions' manual.
***

Nevertheless, as for other S3 methods, I did not change this function compared to the last version 1.0.3 (which is online). I use the \method markup in the Rd file:

***
\usage{
\method{predict}{nnet.time}(object, ..., newdata, newtimes)
}
***

When I use ?  R CMD check --as-cran ?, this NOTE is not identified. Do you have any idea of solution?

Thank you for your support.

Yohann

I have downloaded your package from the CRAN FTP server (under
incoming/archived) and took a look at it. This NOTE is about the
nnet.time function itself (documented in man/nnet.time.Rd), which R CMD
check mistakenly took for a nnet() method on class "time".

This is a problem because you import nnet::nnet, which is an S3
generic, and R is slowly migrating its behaviour in cases like this.
Previously, calling nnet::nnet(structure(..., class = 'time')) would
mistakenly call your nnet.time function, despite it's not intended to
be an S3 method. The idea is to only call S3 methods when they are
registered as such (so, don't call nnet.time in this case), but this
requires writing tests and identifying every case of this pattern
working by mistake. Your nnet.time function is a false positive for
such a test.

It's hard to decide what to do next. Your users would prefer nnet.time
to keep working (so you can't just rename it, especially if you have
other packages depending on it), and CRAN would prefer nnet.time to keep
being not-an-S3-method, but right now it's causing you a NOTE due to
its name.

Did the rejection e-mail say whether you can reply-to-all /
reply-to-sender and explain it's a false positive? Even if you decide
to rename nnet.time and everything else, it would still need to spend
at least one release on CRAN as a deprecated function.

Message-ID: <BL0PR07MB5491A43C8D1DE04DB14647BC80869@BL0PR07MB5491.namprd07.prod.outlook.com>

Hi folks,

I'm the maintainer of the redist package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_redist.html) which was flagged for additional issues with clang-UBSAN and gcc-UBSAN. Both of the 00check.log files say that the status is "OK" at the bottom.

Is there an easy way to identify what is causing the flag? I see things that it could be, for example in the tests Rout files, there are sanitizer errors like:
wilson.cpp:165:34: runtime error: signed integer overflow: -2147483648 * -1 cannot be represented in type 'int'
However, my understanding is that these errors should be expected, as the input is controlled from within the package and checking for these types of errors in every loop would push against the purpose of using C++ for performance here.

That leads me to believe that either I'm looking past the seriousness of one of these sanitizer warnings or I am missing something else that is being flagged.  I've looked at Writing R Extensions part 4.3, but do not see any specific additional information on this. Does anyone have advice or any guidance on figuring out exactly what causes the "Additional Issues" flag and subsequent email about fixing it?

Thank you,
Chris

Unfortunately, it's _all_ the sanitizer errors.

You'd be right to think that signed integer overflow just wraps around
on modern CPUs with no adverse effects on the rest of the execution.
Unfortunately, you'd also need to convince the C++ optimiser, and it's
currently allowed to think otherwise.

In C++, signed integer overflow (and other similar errors, such as
casing NaN to an integer) is undefined behaviour, which, according to
the standard, means that anything can happen after that, ranging from
nothing out of order to a crash and also to silent corruption of
important research results. Other languages define integer overflow to
have a more limited impact (wrap the value around or at least guarantee
a crash), but not C and C++. [*]

Thankfully, I only see one spot where you encounter UB, in
src/wilson.cpp line 165, which should be relatively easy to fix by
adjusting your strategy for calculating the maximum number of tries.
(Do you get a NaN when `remaining` is -1? Why is it -1? Or is it 0?)

-- 
Best regards,
Ivan

[*]
Some old gcc version used to launch the game Nethack when certain kinds
of UB were encountered. The situation has improved in some ways since
that and worsened in others: modern C and C++ compilers, especially
Clang, use UB to guide their optimisation efforts, so if the optimiser
can prove "if A is true then UB happens", it optimises with the
assumption that A is false.

Combined with optimizer bugs, this understanding of undefined
behaviour may lead to funny situations where the inability of the
compiler to prove certain facts about the program leads to
mathematically inconsistent results:

UBSAN reports runtime errors, which means that the overflow has really 
happened, so this clearly should be narrowed down and fixed. I would 
restructure the code to avoid the overflow and only worry about a 
possible slowdown if that happens.

In the code pointed to by the stacktrace

 ??? int max_try = 50 * remaining * ((int) std::log(remaining));
 ??? while (remaining > 0) {

perhaps the problem is when "remaining" is 0 (but I am guessing, I don't 
know the code). Right, the overflow is benign because the value isn't 
used, but one should fix this anyway and it should be easy, e.g.

if (remaining > 0) {

 ? int max_try = ...
 ? while(remaining > 0)

}

this extra condition would not have a measurable overhead in this code.

> That leads me to believe that either I'm looking past the seriousness of one of these sanitizer warnings or I am missing something else that is being flagged.  I've looked at Writing R Extensions part 4.3, but do not see any specific additional information on this. Does anyone have advice or any guidance on figuring out exactly what causes the "Additional Issues" flag and subsequent email about fixing it?

 From the stack traces these are all instances of the same problem. If I 
were you I would simply fix that and submit.

int max_try = 50 * remaining * ((int) std::log(remaining));

you need to ensure remaining > 0.  At some point it became -1.

Message-ID: <16f16b02-5e30-8069-e8ac-3bf6a526d38d@gmail.com>

Recently I updated my package nlsr and it passed all the usual checks and was
uploaded to CRAN. A few days later I got a message that I should "fix" my
package as it had failed in "M1max" tests.

The "error" was actually a failure in a DIFFERENT package that was used as
an example in a vignette. I fixed it in my vignette with try(). However, I
am interested in just where the M1 causes trouble.

As far as I can determine so far, for numerical computations, differences will
show up only when a package is able to take advantage of extended precision
registers in the IEEE arithmetic. I think this means that in pure R, it won't
be seen. Packages that call C or Fortran could do so. However, I've not yet
got a good handle on this.

Does anyone have some small, reproducible examples? (For me, reproducing so
far means making a small package and submitting to macbuilder, as I don't
have an M1 Mac.)

Cheers,

John Nash

John,

you provide no details to go on, but generally the main difference is that arm64 uses 64-bit precision for long double (which is permitted by the C standard), while Intel uses 80-bits of precision (on systems that enable it). That leads to differences in results, e.g. when computing long sums:

set.seed(1); x=rnorm(1e6)

## Intel with extended precision
> sprintf("%a", sum(x))
[1] "0x1.7743176e2372bp+5"

## arm64
> sprintf("%a", sum(x))
[1] "0x1.7743176e23a33p+5"


For R you can get the same results on all platforms by using --disable-long-double which prevents the use of extended precision doubles in R - this is Intel with --disable-long-double:

> sprintf("%a", sum(x))
[1] "0x1.7743176e23a33p+5"

Cheers,
Simon

Sorry to kind of repeat this but I really didn't understand the issues with the prior thread and how it relates to my issue.

I'm getting the error message in

    B_T <- BT(Temp)
    Error in BT(Temp) : DLL requires the use of native symbols
    Execution halted

And frankly, I have no idea what this means.  The function call is pretty simple and meets the requirement of .Fortran

res <- .Fortran('BT', as.double(Temp), as.double(y), as.integer(icode))

and the following matches the R-ext's method for using registration:

extern void F77_NAME(bt)(double *T, double *B, int *icode);

void R_init_IAPWS95(DllInfo *dll)
{
  R_registerRoutines(dll, NULL, NULL, FortranEntries, NULL);
  R_useDynamicSymbols(dll, FALSE);
  R_forceSymbols(dll, TRUE);
}

With

static const R_FortranMethodDef FortranEntries[] = {
  {"bt",        (DL_FUNC) &F77_NAME(bt),        3},
  {NULL, NULL, 0}
};

Furthermore the NAMESPACE includes:

useDynLib(splines, .registration = TRUE, .fixes = "C_")


which matches R-ext.

Since this is only occurring on the Linux versions for the software and I use windows, can someone point me in the right direction to fix this error?

The message says you shouldn't be using the string 'BT' in the .Fortran 
call, you should be using the object that was produced by 
R_registerRoutines.  That's probably named BT (without any quotes), 
though you can add a prefix in useDynLib() in your NAMESPACE file.

So your call should look like this:

   res <- .Fortran(BT, as.double(Temp), as.double(y), as.integer(icode))

Sorry, that should be

       res <- .Fortran(bt, as.double(Temp), as.double(y), as.integer(icode))

because of the mapping to lowercase.

... this line ask R to enfore a (registered, the two preceeding lines) symbol.

This is a conflict, and R-devel now flags it as error (when a 'switch it on'
environment variable is set). Sometimes such changes become mandatory.

In any event it is something you can change. Either stick with the character
variable identifying your routine (and likely suffer epsilon-size slowdowns
for the lookup) and go through with calling the routine by its registered
symbol.  I do not interface much with .Fortran() and was under the impression
that its use is (strongly !!) discouraged (as is .C()) given that using
.Call() from R is so much more efficient (so you'd write a C(++) wrapper to
receive arguments and then have the C(++) wrapper call your Fortran routine.
There are prior threads about the mechanics of that in the list archive.

Take another look at R-exts, specifically

https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Registering-native-routines

Your call

     R_forceSymbols(dll, TRUE);

says you want foreign function calls to only work with entry points
specified by R objects representing native symbols. This was not being
enforced but is now in R devel.

Your NAMESPACE file directive

     useDynLib(splines, .registration = TRUE, .fixes = "C_")

says that these R objects should use a C_ prefix, so your .Fortran
call should be

    res <- .Fortran(C_bt, as.double(Temp), as.double(y), as.integer(icode))

So you can either fix your .Fortran call to be consistent with what
you have asked R to use, or drop the R_forceSymbols call.

Best,

luke
