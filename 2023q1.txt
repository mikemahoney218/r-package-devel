Hello, All:


	  What are current recommendations for GitHub Action?


	  My most recent change to "sos" generated "Failed to get R" for

We ran into a similar problem and switching to v2 did the trick.

As the error is common against your _all three_ of your Ubuntu runs, you
could consider the possibility that the events are correlated.  Most often it
simply means a (temporary, usually) network or server outage.  I would wait,
and then relaunch (which these days you can do just for the failed jobs).

It is also worth paying attention to warnings such as

   Warning: r-lib/actions/setup-r at v1 is deprecated. Please update your

	  Thanks to Zhian Kamvar and Dirk Eddelbuettel for encouraging me to 
look at the warning.


	  I replaced a few lined of my "R-CMD-check.yaml" file with the the 
"v3" and "v2" versions in the example in 
"https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v2/examples" and deleted 
subsequent lines that I didn't understand, and I got an instant failure: 
  It didn't run even one of the 5 tests.  Then I did "git revert" with 
the version number from GitHub and changed several lines to match the 
example with the succeeding yaml code.  GitHub Action ran and failed on 
all 5 platforms.  I did "git revert" with that and changed 
"r-lib/actions/setup-r at v1" to "r-lib/actions/setup-r at v2".  With that, 
R-release ran successfully on Unbuntu as well as Windows and macOS.


	  However, Ubuntu failed with devel and oldrel1, complaining, "there is 
no package called ?rcmdcheck?".

If we start from the error message and work backwards, it's easy to see
that `rcmdcheck` fails to install because it depends on `curl`, which
also fails to install. `curl` fails to install because the virtual
machine running the GitHub Action doesn't have libcurl headers
installed; there's even an error message about that, but it's not fatal:

------------------------- ANTICONF ERROR ---------------------------
Configuration failed because libcurl was not found. Try installing:
 * deb: libcurl4-openssl-dev (Debian, Ubuntu, etc)
 * rpm: libcurl-devel (Fedora, CentOS, RHEL)
If libcurl is already installed, check that 'pkg-config' is in your
PATH and PKG_CONFIG_PATH contains a libcurl.pc file. If pkg-config
is unavailable you can set INCLUDE_DIR and LIB_DIR manually via:
R CMD INSTALL --configure-vars='INCLUDE_DIR=... LIB_DIR=...'
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't have enough experience in the abstraction layers involved, but
if you stuff a `sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev` (which should
run as a system command line, just like the "Install system
dependencies" step) somewhere before the "Install dependencies" step,
it should work.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] S3 generic/method consistency false positive when
 dplyr imported
Message-ID: <CAGPRvNDXHT-ZB4H6if_RRRwSFahUFDWbuKeppFBihvVQ4DodWA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm modifying a package so as to remove its dependence on the superseded
packages *reshape2* and *plyr*, in favor of dependence on *dplyr*.  In
particular, I'm just importing the one function `dplyr::bind_rows`.

A curious thing happens, however, as soon as I include this among the
imports.  I begin to get R CMD check NOTEs alerting me to the presence of
S3 generic inconsistencies.  These are associated with two functions in the
package: `filter.mean` and `filter.traj`, which the checker mistakes for S3
methods based on the generic `stats::filter` function.  Actually, these are
not S3 methods.  In fact, they are S4 generics and declared as such.

When *dplyr* is not imported, R CMD check is happy with these functions.
When it is imported, R CMD check complains.

Now I understand that it may be preferable to move away from functions with
names containing dots for this reason, and in fact I am already doing so,
but I think the question is a good one:

Why does inclusion of *dplyr* in the import list appear to trigger these
warnings when they were not there before?

Thanks in advance for any insight you can give!

I think that's because dplyr itself contains an S3 generic named
"filter", and having a package namespace loaded (not even attached) is
enough to take its registered S3 methods into consideration for method
dispatch. Here we have an opposite situation, though, and your
functions aren't registered as S3 methods. Will your function still be
called if you artificially construct a wrong object and feed it to
dplyr::filter while your package namespace is attached?

library(YOURPACKAGE)
dplyr::filter(structure(list(), class = 'traj'))

Additionally, stats::filter doesn't seem to be an S3 generic, so that's
one thing that the check gets confused about.

Thanks for the fast reply!

When I follow your suggestion above, I get

library(pomp)
dplyr::filter(structure(list(), class = 'traj'))

Error in UseMethod("filter") :
  no applicable method for 'filter' applied to an object of class "traj"

Which is not what would happen if my filter.traj function were called.  So
the S3 dispatch system is not confused.  Thus this really is a false
positive.

It still leaves open the question, why does this suddenly appear when dplyr
is loaded?  If I understand you correctly, it would be triggered by the
inclusion of the generic 'filter' in dplyr, which was previously not
present. However, since the S3 dispatch system is not itself confused, I
suppose it must be the case that the S3 generic/method consistency checker
itself is confused.  I wonder, how does the checker decide when to throw a
NOTE?  Is it a simple pattern-matching system, something like "If X.Y is
exported, where X is a generic and Y is any string and X.Y is not declared
as an S3 method, then throw NOTE"?

The aim of the check is a bit different: "if an S3 method for generic X
and class Y exists, and the formal arguments of X.Y don't extend the
formal arguments of X in a certain way, then throw a NOTE", but then
something gets wrong about deciding whether X.Y is an S3 method, and
once filter.mean is decided to be an S3 method, of course it doesn't
match the formals of filter.

This function is even a public API of the tools package, see
?tools::checkS3methods:
https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/blob/b57918fd104962415a752ea7db12dcf4f3f5219f/src/library/tools/R/QC.R#L2310-L2560

Interesting. I wonder if there's are other remaining ways to confuse
the S3 dispatch system into thinking your function is an S3 method that
the check is supposed to guard against. For instance, the following is
likely to work with your package:

library(pomp)
library(dplyr)
identical(filter.traj, getS3method('filter', 'traj'))
# as long as there's a visible 'filter' generic, getS3method will
# locate filter.traj as the method

...despite the method lookup seems to (correctly) fail, as you've just
demonstrated. But on older versions of R, this used to wrongly resolve
the call:

library(Ropj)
read <- function(x, ...) UseMethod('read')
identical(read.opj, getS3method('read','opj')) # works in R-devel
# [1] TRUE
read(structure(0, class = 'opj')) # calls read.opj in old R
# Error in read_opj(file, encoding, tree) :
#   Expecting a single string value: [type=double; extent=1].

I'm afraid I'm out of my depth here. The old, wrong behaviour seems to
match the R language definition
<https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.html#Definition>.
The current behaviour seems to do the right thing? by letting the
functions opt into being methods, but then getS3method() seems to
contradict what actually gets called. Should we be fixing the
documentation, the implementation, or the check?

Can you try stepping through tools::checkS3methods('pomp') (or
tools::checkS3methods(dir = 'path/to/source/directory')) to see where
'filter' appears in the list of generics and where the

Excellent suggestion, Ivan. Thanks for pointing out just where to look.

I stepped through tools::checkS3methods("pomp") and it does appear to be
roughly as I conjectured.  Namely, all functions are extracted from the
pomp namespace and checked against a list of generics.  The check that is
performed is a simple pattern-match (i.e.,
startsWith(paste0(genericname,"."), functionname)).  Clearly this is prone
to false positives.  I wonder what would be involved in tightening this up
so that it agrees with what the actual dispatch mechanism gives....

Interestingly, there is a whitelist, implemented mostly via
tools::nonS3methods().  The function (plyr::rbind.fill) that I had been
importing is there but its replacement (dplyr::bind_rows) is not. So this
answers my original question.

The whitelist appears to be a somewhat arbitrary compilation of functions
from various packages, with no obvious theme.  For example, dplyr is not on
the list, but ElectoGraph is; reshape is on the list but reshape2 is not.
The impression of arbitrariness is reinforced by the fact that packages
that Wickham has for whatever reason decided are superseded are present in
that list and packages he considers for the moment to be worth maintaining
are not.  Doing a quick 'git blame' I see that the whitelist was mostly put
together in 2013, with a few additions in 2015 and much more occasionally
since.

It occurs to me that there ought to be a mechanism whereby a package author
could add to the list of non-S3 methods.  I see from the mailing list
archives that there was discussion of this back in 2015 (
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2015-June/071356.html), with what
looked like consensus that there ought to be such a facility, but nothing
seems to have actually been done about it.  I conjecture that the decision
was to just fold false positives into the whitelist on an ad hoc basis.

Version 2.0.0 of my ?evclass' package was rejected for the second time with the following note from the Debian check (the Windows check is OK):

* checking package subdirectories ... NOTE
Problems with news in ?NEWS?:
  Cannot process chunk/lines:
    Version 2.0.0 includes an implementation of radial basis function neural network classifiers, as well as functions to express the outputs of trained logistic regression or feed-forward neural network classifiers as Dempster-Shafer mass functions. These methods are based on an interpretation of the operations performed in neural networks as the combination of weights of evidence by Dempster's rule (see: "T. Denoeux, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks and Dempster-Shafer Theory: a New Perspective. Knowledge-Based Systems 176:54-67, 2019").

I already tried to change the NEWS file but I have no idea where the error might come from. The NEWS file is a text file created by TextEdit on Mac with UTF-8 encoding, so I don?t see how there could be hidden special characters in it. I see nothing special in the line that could not be processed. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Best,

Thierry

The problem is that the NEWS files are supposed to have a certain
format (documented in help(news)). For a long time, this hasn't been
enforced, but now there are checks in place that require NEWS to be
written to specifications.

I think that your line can be transformed as follows in order to parse
correctly:

Changes in version 2.0.0

 * Implementation of radial basis function neural network classifiers,
   as well as functions to express the outputs of trained logistic
   regression or feed-forward neural network classifiers as
   Dempster-Shafer mass functions. These methods are based on an
   interpretation of the operations performed in neural networks as the
   combination of weights of evidence by Dempster's rule (see: "T.
   Denoeux, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks and Dempster-Shafer
   Theory: a New Perspective. Knowledge-Based Systems 176:54-67, 2019").

You can also write an inst/NEWS.Rd file in Rd format.

As you can see from reading ?news, it is preferred to provide a
bulleted list of the changes.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Mysterious "invalid z limit"
Message-ID: <c9f10ae8-a82a-c3c0-bac8-1e9b4948366f@gmail.com>

Hi,

I am in the middle of developing a new package, which contains a 
markdown-knitr-html vignette. When I try to run

R CMD build [mypackagedirectory]

I get an error message

Quitting from lines 330-336
Error: processing vignette? failed with diagnostics:
invalid z limits

If I run the same markdown script interactively inside R Studio, there 
is no error.
If I knit the markdown script inside R Studio, it produces the correct 
HTML output, with no error.

The offending lines of code (the chunk at 330-336) invoke an "image" 
method on an object of a class defined in the package, which in turn 
computes a matrix from items inside the object and calls image.default, 
which is presumably where the error is coming from.

Two questions: (1) How is it possible that the same code works error 
free in the RStudio contexts, but fails in the attempt to build the package?
(2) Any suggestions on how to debug something that only throws an error 
from "R CMD build" would be most welcome.

Thanks in advance,
 ? Kevin

Debugging that sort of thing is hard.  Here's what I would try:

 From inside an R session, run

   tools:::.build_packages("[mypackagedirectory]")

That runs the code that R CMD build runs, so it might trigger the same 
error.  If so, debug in the usual way, with traceback(), etc.

If that doesn't trigger the error, try it using a different front-end, 
e.g. running R at the command line instead of running it in RStudio.

If you still can't trigger it, then start modifying the vignette to find 
the exact line that causes the error (e.g. by commenting out the second 
half of the code in that chunk; did the error go away? etc.).  Then 
modify it again to save all the inputs to the bad line in a file before 
running it, and see if running that line in a different context still 
triggers the error. Etc.

A frequent cause of such errors is that in the offending scenario a method is not visible, so the call goes directly to the default method. This often can be verified by temporarily printing something from your method when it gets control.

Without more details it is difficult to be more specific. It may be a missing import or export, for example.

When knitting the vignette from RStudio, it uses the package you
already have installed. When knitting the vignette from R CMD build, it
uses the code it's about to package. Could it be that your source code
is different from the copy installed in your library?

R CMD build --no-build-vignettes should let you proceed and get a
tarball that could be installed. Hopefully you'll be able to reproduce
the error then.

A terrific answer; thanks. (I am kicking myself for not realizing the 
answer you gave to question 1. Of course that's the explanation. Too 
many consecutive hours debugging other items to get to that point, I 
suppose.)

A very helpful answer. For some reason (probably because I have an 
ancient perl script that automates the steps i take when building and 
checking packages), I keep forgetting that the "tools" package let's me 
do these things from within R.

I had already isolated the offending line ("plot(obj)") inside the chunk 
where the error occurred, and removed any additional arguments. I 
wrapped that line in a "try" command followed by a conditional 
"traceback()" to find the problem.? This allowed the package build to 
knit the vignette and provide some feedback about what was going on. It 
turned out that I had copied and pasted an assignment line of the form

main <- [compute the title]

from earlier in the code and pasted it directly as an argument to the 
call to image.default. And R did exactly what I told it to (not 
surprisingly), and interpreted the value of that assignment as the 
unnamed "zlim" option that would have been the corresponding positional 
argument that should have been there.

And yes, I still use "left arrow" <- instead of equals = as assignments. 
(Heck, I even use emacs and ESS with a leftover keybinding that uses the 
underscore key to insert the left arrow. Apparently, I'm ancient myself.)

	  If you use GitHub, I highly recommend using "GitHub Action" as 
described by Wickham and Bryan, R Packages:


https://r-pkgs.org/code.html#code-style


	  I'm not sure the best way to get it set up, but I have all my 
packages on GitHub configured so each "push" that changes anything has 
"R CMD Check" run on 5 different platforms:  The release version of R on 
the latest Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu plus the development version and 
the most recent old release on Ubuntu.  I rarely run R CMD check on my 
local machine anymore:  I just "git commit" and "git push".  Then GitHub 
Action manages testing on those 5 platforms.


	  To be precise, I do "git status" before "git push" to make sure I 
have "committed" everything I want to commit before I "git push".  And I 
do "git pull" to make sure a collaborator hasn't "pushed" something new 
I should look at before I "git push".


	  Finally, I want to thank again G?bor Cs?rdi who helped me greatly get 
past problems I hand with "GitHub Action" for my "sos" package.  He 
provided example workflows in:


https://github.com/r-lib/actions/blob/v2-branch/examples/check-standard.yaml


	  I also needed LaTeX support, for which G?bor suggested the following:

I have been using R-Forge for many years for package development. And I
have been using GitLab for other projects almost as long.

However, over the past few months, the R-Forge support seems to be
decaying, and I now have several projects that won't currently build there
because of various items that appear to need fixing at their end. So, I am
actively exploring what it will take to move packages and projects to git.

I already know how to use a git client to clone a Subversion repository
from R-Forge (using "git svn"). And how to change the remote origin to push
it to a new git location. (And I  may also be willing to lose the revision
history if it is going to make the transition easier.)

I am now at the step of understanding the recent changes at GitLab with
respect to support for "Educational" or "Open Source" status, especially in
terms of how many monthly minutes of CI/CD time I can use for free. When
working on a new package, I tend to make lots of small commit-pushes, and
it sounds like each one of those will eat up minutes. So, any advice on how
to manage that issue would be greatly appreciated.

Best,
  Kevin

	  R-Forge was wonderful for me when I started using it.  Then several 
years ago, I started having problems like you described.  A few years 
ago I migrated from R-Forge to GitHub.


	  One problem I encountered in the transition:  On R-Forge, I had 
multiple packages in the same R-Forge project.  I had to split them 
apart for GitHub.

	  When I first got into Subversion, I remember Doug Bates saying, 
"Commit early and often."  The word "Commit" doesn't mean the same in 
Git as in Subversion, so I would encourage you to "Git push early and 
often."


	  There may be limits on free use of GitHub, but I'm not aware of them: 
  If you want a private account, you need to pay for that, but the 
charges for that are not much.


	  If anyone knows anything different from what I've just said, I hope 
they will disabuse my of this part of my ignorance.

   The free tier of Github allows 2000 minutes/month of continuous 
integration testing for private repos, and unlimited (???) for public 
repos.  (2000 minutes/month is more than I've ever needed.)

   Furthermore, it's pretty easy to set up github actions so that it 
only runs tests if you ask it to (by appending e.g. "[run ci]" to your 
commit message), or in opt-out mode (i.e., skip tests if "[skip ci]" is 
in your commit message).

Thanks for mentioning the possibility to opt out of the CMD checks on GitHub actions, which I didn't know about before. I also have GHA set up and I like the concept of automated testing, but one thing that bothers me is that sometimes I make a small but necessary commit (e.g. to fix a bug) and it runs the whole suite of tests and checks on all functions which takes around five minutes. Most of the time this is overkill and it occurs to me that it has an unnecessary environmental impact. Perhaps this is something to think about occasionally in our CI/CD setups.

So now I'm off to tweak my GitHub actions...

Did you have to split the packages to get the CI/CD tools to work? 
Because,to me, it looks as though I can install multiple different R 
packages from the same git project, using something like

library(devtools)
install_gitlab("krcoombes/[PROJECT]", "pkg/[PACKAGE]")

Best,
 ? Kevin

Dear list members,

I am getting the following response when I try to upload growthPheno_2.1.17.tar.gz:

Detected package information [non-editable]
In case of errors reupload the package or contact cran team

The package was successfully uploaded on 2022-11-15. It is available on https://github.com/briencj/growthPheno.

I have scoured the DESCRIPTION file and compared it with the DESCRIPTION file for dae, another of my packages that has been successfully uploaded in the last 12 hours.

I have run R CMD  --as-cran growthPheno_2.1.17.tar.gz with the final status being OK.

I am stumped as to what is causing the problem. Can anyone throw any lot on what the problem might be?

Thanks in advance,

Cheers,

 Chris

That's not an error. This message is to inform you that the following
fields have been extracted from your DESCRIPTION file and aren't
supposed to be edited by hand. Is there a better way to phrase that?

Do you see anything out of place in the form? If the form content seems
OK, click the "Submit package" button near the bottom of the page to
continue.

Hi Ivan,

Thanks for taking up my query.

I realized after I sent the message that I should have added that the package files is being dropped as well. It replaces my file name with "No file chosen".  Consequently I cannot continue submit the package.

I saw it as an error message because it is not a message that I have seen in the many times that I have uploaded a package to CRAN.

My interpretation of the message was that there is some "non-editable" material in the package information, most likely the DESCRIPTION file.

However, I doubted that this could be the case because the only changes in the DESCRIPTION file since I uploaded Version 2.1.16 two months ago are in the Version, Date, Packaged and Suggests, the latter having writeXLS removed because it is no longer needed.  I have verified that these are the only changed by extracting the DESCRIPTION file from both growthPheno_2.1.16 and 2.1.17 and doing a file comparison on them.

This led me to think that the problem must be in other than the DESCRIPTION file.

Unfortunately, I remain unable to upload the package.

Cheers,

  Chris

I understand that this behaviour is counter-intuitive, but that seems
to be the way it's supposed to work. Package submission is a multi-step
process:

Step 1 involves providing your name, your e-mail address and the
package file. Once uploaded, the package file stays somewhere at CRAN,
at least for a while.

Step 2 involves making sure that you've uploaded the right package.
You're shown your name, e-mail address, the optional comment and the
fields from the DESCRIPTION file. The "Package:" file upload field
should be empty because CRAN already has a copy of the file.

Pressing the "Re-upload the package/Edit information" will repeat the
step 1 and take you back to the same place, just before the step 2. In
order to progress, you need to press the "Submit package" button below
the form, despite the "Package:" file upload field is empty.

Do the "Title:", "Description:", "Authors(s):" fields contain the
information for your package? Does the "Submit package" button work for
you? Are there any other messages there?

Perhaps the CRAN submission form should show some indication that the
file has been uploaded near the file entry field during step 2?

Hi Ivan,

The submit button has worked!!!!

You are right that it is counterintuitive and I have been well trained not to submit things to CRAN that contain errors :-)

I agree that something like "Package uploaded" would be better than "No file chosen" in Stage 2, afterall I have chosen a file.

Thanks very much for your help. All's well that ends well.

Cheers,

  Chris

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Rcmd check skip example
Message-ID: <CAJGy0hd219xgqs0_gfiu_gQRNfZHcq+u7Qx1+hXV9iNQE2TjJA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

In the process of adding examples to the .RD file, I noticed
Rcmd check seems to skip certain example code.

I put my example code  x%*%y%*%z  (matrix multiplication) in the
RD file. After running Rcmd check
(on windows) and look into the xxx.Rcheck directory,
  xxx-EX.ROUT  file, it seems that the example check stopped
 at x (i.e. everything after % sign is ignored, like LaTeX).

That seems like a bug. Can anyone confirm on newer version?

Mine:

else)

Rd documentation is latex like, so comments can be included with a percent
symbol. You should write \% if you intend to write a literal percent
symbol.

R 4.1.0 was released before Windows 11, but even in R-devel, 
sessionInfo() reports "Windows 10" on "Windows 11". The problem is that 
the information comes from win.version()/GetVersionEx() and, as also 
documented in ?win.version, this may return "compatibility version".

With the already released versions of R and current R-devel, one can 
tell Windows 11 from the build number (your 22621 is Windows 11 22H2, 
22000 is Windows 11 21H2).

Thanks for spotting and reporting this.

Indeed, the versions from 10.0.22000 are called Windows 11.
Windows 10 builds are expected to stay below 10.0.22000.
It is up to Microsoft why the label their version 10.x.y as Windows 11 
(well, they labelled version 5.x.y as Windows 2000 etc., so nothing new 
here).

Message-ID: <992486ed-6a0c-4b12-f306-1a18cb573d4e@effectivedefense.org>

Hello, All:


	  The NAMESPACE file in


https://github.com/JamesRamsay5/fda


is corrupted.  RStudio 2022.12.0+353 (the current version) won't open 
it, complaining, "File is binary rather than text so cannot be opened by 
the source editor."  TextEdit (macOS 11.7.2) opened it as normal, as did 
vi.  Both allowed me to make and save changes, but RStudio still gave 
the same error.  Worse, after "git push", GitHub Action on 5 platforms 
ended with:


** byte-compile and prepare package for lazy loading
Error in parse(nsFile, keep.source = FALSE, srcfile = NULL) :
   1:1: unexpected input


	  That's the same error I've gotten with "R CMD build fda" locally.


	  Suggestions?
	  Thanks,
	  Spencer Graves

Your NAMESPACE file starts with a U+FEFF ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE.
You'll need to remove it, e.g. by re-creating the first line.

Note that this is also called "byte order mark" (BOM). Tell your editor 
not to create files with BOM.

You can also fix in R:

x <- readLines(..., encoding="UTF-8-BOM")
writeLines(x, ......)

	  In RStudio 2022.12.0+353 (the current version),


tools::showNonASCIIfile('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JamesRamsay5/fda/master/NAMESPACE')


returned "char(0)".  'readLines' and 'writeLines' as Uwe suggested 
failed to fix it for me.


	  The first problem I noticed with this was that RStudio could not read 
the NAMESPACE file.  When I tried, it said, "File is binary rather than 
text so cannot be opened by the source editor."  I changed something 
using a different editor and did "git commit" and "git push", and got 
the error on GitHub that I reported above.  I copied the file elsewhere, 
deleted it locally and from GitHub, then recreated it in LibreOffice by 
manually typing the first and last lines then copying the rest from a 
copy I had saved elsewhere.  The RStudio would open the file, but I 
still get the same error message as above from both "R CMD build fda" 
locally and from GitHub Action at:


https://github.com/JamesRamsay5/fda


	  Other suggestions?

I think Uwe's suggestion was to check out the file, apply his two steps, 
and commit it again.  Your showNonASCIIfile() call was trying to work on 
something else.  Maybe your other commands were too?

Another possibility is to roll back all your changes to that file until 
you have a copy you can work with.  I think commit ab455089 is probably 
the bad one; Github shows invisible changes to the first line.  You 
don't want those.

Setting the locale to "C" (or perhaps some other non-UTF-8 locale) will
show the BOM bytes.  E.g., on Windows I get:

> Sys.getlocale()
[1] "LC_COLLATE=English_United States.utf8;LC_CTYPE=English_United

xFEFF isn't a BOM in a UTF-8 file, its not anything.   The UTF-8 BOM is a
different sequence of bits.  If tools treat it as a BOM, that is arguably a
problem.

You're right.  FEFF is the UTF-16 big endian BOM.  UTF-16 is a 16 bit 
encoding, not at all the same as UTF-8.  I don't know how to read UTF-16 
in R. Uwe's advice was for UTF-8.

Hello, All:


	  My attempts to fix this problem exposed what seems to be a completely 
unrelated problem:  All five GitHub Actions end now with:


Error: package or namespace load failed for ?fda? in namespaceExport(ns, 
exports):
  undefined exports: refinery


	  The package includes ~man/refinery.Rd, ~data/refinery.rda, and 
NAMESPACE includes "export( ... refinery, ...)".


	  ???
	  I have Bitdefender installed on this computer.  A "Quick Scan" 
produced nothing just now.


	  Thanks,
	  Spencer

I think if you declare something as data by putting it in the data 
directory and using LazyData:true, you shouldn't also declare it as an 
export in the NAMESPACE file.

	  I got the same negative results after deleting "LazyData: true" from 
DESCRIPTION.  (That's what I would expect, because there are 17 other 
*.rda files in the data subdirectory that are are mentioned in NAMESPACE 
and are not creating a problem.  In 2009 the package included both 
"data/refinery.rda" and "man/refinery.Rd".  They were erroneously 
removed at some point.  I'm now trying to restore them.)

So you have declared LazyData: true?
How does the other package access the data object? By imprt directives?
Perhaps you exported the data in the past via the NAMSPACE file? But 
then it has to be in sysdata.rda?



Sorry for the confusion with the BOM.
The encoding sting for UTF-16  with byte order mark is "UTF-16BE".
I'd believe much more should have gone wrong then. Perhaps it was some 
editor that really messed it up?

Uwe Ligges

Message-ID: <CAFDswJvzbtDy8v0xdNZd+KOH-r_4hUFQupuHxbLTScobw2vmpg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

In my recent re-submission with a bug-fix of the hdf5r package, I got a new
set of warnings from the compiler, one being that I shouldn't be using
'sprintf'.

Is there a simple replacement that I can use?

Thanks

You should use snprintf() which has an extra argument to state the size 
of the buffer receiving the string.  For example,

  char text[32];
  sprintf(text, "%.4g", value);

could be written as

  char text[32];
  snprintf(text, 32, "%.4g", value);

This will write a string with at most 31 characters before the NUL at 
the end, and avoids the possibility of a buffer overrun.

Hi,

thanks for the tip! Is that available everywhere or do I need to set
compiler requirements?

You shouldn't need any special requirements.  I think this was 
standardized in C99, which is supported by default in R.  Not sure which 
C++ version adopted it, but it's available there too.

I just cloned the repository, and saw the same error as you saw.  Then I 
followed my advice, and removed `refinery` from the NAMESPACE file, and 
the error went away.

Since you don't have `LazyData: true` in the current version, you need 
to run `data(refinery)` to make that dataset available.  That does work.

I also tried restoring `LazyData:true` as well as removing `refinery` 
from NAMESPACE, and that works too, without the need to call 
`data(refinery)`.  The variable is just available.

I'm not sure which *.rda files you are talking about that "are mentioned 
in NAMESPACE".  Now that I've removed `refinery` in my copy, I don't see 
any of them.

Even Microsoft added snprintf to Visual C++ in 2015 (not that that matters
for R).

And even better idiom (which I only came to too late for the update of a few
of my packages) is to rely on sizeof() as in

    char text[32];
    snprintf(text, sizeof(text), "%.4g", value);

which works for many / most simple cases of such static buffers.

Sometimes this sprintf compiler 'noise' is shrapnel from other packages we
include as headers, and harder to fix.  Brian Ripley kindly alerted us to one
remaining instance in the Rcpp headers which we fixed in October; the updated
package is currently awaiting its fate during its bi-annual update cycle but
is held in the dark and deep bowels of CRAN awaiting inspection (nine days
and counting now) as is package BH which in its annual update got a number of
headers refreshed from its upstream, plus an extra round of polish from
me. It too is available as an update in its git repo, and otherwise hiding in
those dark CRAN bowels.  I keep telling myself I should remain hopeful that
maybe one day we get to take advantage of it. Hopefully soon.

 Dear all,

I try to submit a new version of the package phangorn and got the mail back:

"Dear maintainer,

I am kind of puzzled as to what the problem is, but it might well be that I
missed something? I appreciate any suggestions.

   Seems pretty mysterious to me! (No cryptic NOTEs anywhere in the 
logs, other than the inevitable "Note_to_CRAN_maintainers")

   I will be curious to see if anyone else finds something, but my guess 
is a hiccup on the CRAN end (i.e., you'll end up sending e-mail to the 
CRAN maintainers to clarify what's going on)

Is this the whole e-mail? There may be a list of problems at the end of
the message, right after the signature ("Best regards, CRAN teams'
auto-check service"). It may be about the time your vignette took to
build on Windows, but I'm not sure about that.

Please reduce the vignette build timings by using
  - small toy data only

Otherwise we cannot afford checking the vignette regularly on CRAN.

Hello all,

I am submitting a minor update to one of my CRAN package (BIGL), and get strange errors on R-devel on win-builder - https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/BIGL_1.6.7_20230119_225109/Windows/00check.log and https://win-builder.r-project.org/o339zPAR6pWG/00check.log (different symbols)

It shows strange output like "`1Y???hA?..." before tests and cryptic error-messages like "unable to translate '(<be><b1><a7>m' to a wide string"
I can also see similar output in examples - https://win-builder.r-project.org/o339zPAR6pWG/examples_and_tests/BIGL-Ex.Rout 

I don't get any isses on debian R-devel, on R-release on windows, and also can't reproduce the errors locally on a windows machine with R-devel, so I am a bit lost.
Would anyone have any idea of what goes wrong?

Kind regards,
Maxim Nazarov

These are errors and warnings in regex operations (grep, gsub) due to 
that the input data is not a valid string (validly encoded string). 
Because it is not valid, it cannot be converted to a wide string, which 
is needed for the regex operation, as this uses TRE.

So, you need to find out why the input strings are invalid. Common 
causes of such problems are that they are in a different encoding from 
the one told to R or to some other software on the way. Also the data 
may be corrupted.

It should be fairly easy from the error output to find out which 
operations have failed in the vignette. Perhaps you could find out how 
their inputs were generated.

If you have a Windows machine with R running in UTF-8 as the native 
encoding, with recent R-devel, and the error is still not reproducible, 
try to confirm that the inputs for the failing operations are correct.

Thank you, Tomas, for your insights!

I think I found the root cause of the problem - my package uses the `nlsLM` function from the `minpack.lm` package and coincidentally the new version of that package was submitted to CRAN recently.
Looking at https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/minpack.lm_1.2-3_20230117_110122/reverseDependencies/changes.txt - we can see that this new version of minpack.lm is causing similar errors in many of its reverse dependencies.

In fact if I install that version from https://cran.r-project.org/incoming/archive/ I get the strange output when running a simple example from `nlsLM` even on linux:
```
install.packages("https://cran.r-project.org/incoming/archive/minpack.lm_1.2-3.tar.gz")
library(minpack.lm)
DNase1 <- subset(DNase, Run == 1)
capture.output(fm1DNase1 <- nlsLM(density ~ SSlogis(log(conc), Asym, xmid, scal), DNase1))
## produces "\xa8\002\x8c\003\x9bU"
```
this seems to come from the C code, which I don't fully understand.

So I guess it is an unfortunate timing, and I just need to wait for the minpack.lm package to be fixed, but I'm wondering (philosophically) if it is correct that my package is checked against non-released (non-approved) version of minpack.lm and rejected because of its shortcomings?

Kind regards,
Maxim Nazarov

These are errors and warnings in regex operations (grep, gsub) due to 
that the input data is not a valid string (validly encoded string). 
Because it is not valid, it cannot be converted to a wide string, which 
is needed for the regex operation, as this uses TRE.

So, you need to find out why the input strings are invalid. Common 
causes of such problems are that they are in a different encoding from 
the one told to R or to some other software on the way. Also the data 
may be corrupted.

It should be fairly easy from the error output to find out which 
operations have failed in the vignette. Perhaps you could find out how 
their inputs were generated.

If you have a Windows machine with R running in UTF-8 as the native 
encoding, with recent R-devel, and the error is still not reproducible, 
try to confirm that the inputs for the failing operations are correct.

I think that is likely bad luck, in that your package was being 
evaluated at the same time as the new minpack.lm, and CRAN/winbuilder 
don't isolate the builds.  If you resubmit unchanged (I'd do this on 
winbuilder, not CRAN) you may get a more reasonable outcome.

I'm 99% sure this comes from the following changes to the package:

--- minpack.lm_1.2-2/src/fcn_message.c  2020-03-23 10:54:03.000000000 +0300
+++ minpack.lm_1.2-3/src/fcn_message.c  2023-01-17 09:30:05.000000000 +0300
@@ -3,24 +3,24 @@
 char *fcn_message(char *msg, int info, int n, int nit)
 {
     if      (info == 1)
-        sprintf(msg, "Relative error in the sum of squares is at most `ftol'.");
+        Rprintf(msg, "Relative error in the sum of squares is at most `ftol'.");
     else if (info == 2)

(And so on for other values of `info`.)

sprintf() takes a string pointer to write into as its first argument.
Rprintf(), on the other hand, prints straight to the R console; its
first argument is the format string. Given a valid pointer to an
uninitialised string instead of the format string, Rprintf prints stack
garbage to the console, ignoring the following arguments. My guess is
that the maintainers either intended to remove the msg argument
altogether or needed to use snprintf() and pass the buffer size to
fcn_message().

 If you had to choose one binary to preserve for a pkg, which would it be?
Message-ID: <em688ae61e-9014-4e28-9c9b-7af67631a44a@6e5c1f4b.com>

This is not a perfect list for this question, but possibly a good list.

I maintain 'groundhog', a package that seeks to simplify reproducibility 
of R code based on R packages.
It has so far relied on MRAN  for binaries of older/archived versions of 
packages, but MRAN is shutting down.
Posit (R Studio) also has archived binaries, but they are less 
transparent about it,  they do not have Mac binaries, and I am a little 
uncomfortable relying on a 3rd party again, specially because their 
archive is more difficult to navigate and this is part of a for-profit 
venture so access is far from guaranteed. So...

I will create an independent archive of all binaries for packages for 
Windows and Mac machines.

Instead of having daily backups like MRAN does/did, i will keep just one 
binary per combination of package, version, R version, operating system.
So a single 'rio' 0.5.0 binary for Windows for R-4.2.x, for example 
(MRAN keeps a daily copy of such file instead, possibly with 100+ 
identical or nearly identical copies).

I need to decide whether to keep the first binary that was uploaded to 
CRAN, the last one, or one in the middle, etc.
In  concept binaries should work regardless of which file is chosen, but 
there is a reason, i guess they are rebuilt so often so it may make a 
difference in the margin which of the many builts available in MRAN is 
chosen to be preserved. I think it has to do with changes in underlying 
packages used to build them, but am not sure.
This decision will also guide future archiving, which of the many 
versions of to be uploaded to CRAN binaries are preserved.

So, if you have experience or knowledge on this, which of the many 
previously created binaries for a given package version would you choose 
to archive long-term?
Groundhog will always attempt to install from source if a binary fails, 
so a certain error rate is tolerable.

Message-ID: <PH0PR06MB71575B163CB7557D3E0E146AEDC89@PH0PR06MB7157.namprd06.prod.outlook.com>

Dear all,

Hope you are well! Recently, in the check before a re-submission, I got an unexpected note when doing R CMD Check using rhub::check_for_cran(), saying that "Examples with CPU (user + system) or elapsed time > 5s".

I didn't expect this note to appear because the same examples didn't cause this note in the previous submission last December. Compared with the previous submission, we only edited documentation, there was no change in the R code for functions of our package.

To double-check, I downloaded our previous submission from CRAN and checked it again. It's strange that this current CRAN version also has this note now. However, when submitting it last December, there were no such notes. Do you have any idea why the R CMD Check results are inconsistent?

Since the examples caused no note in the last submission and were successfully submitted to CRAN, I'm not sure whether I should change the examples in this re-submission to eliminate this sudden note. Any suggestions will be appreciated!

Thank you!
Ying

Package maintainers recently got a message telling us not to use 
sprintf() any more.  I guess the minpack.lm maintainer either didn't 
read the whole message carefully enough and used Rprintf as a substitute 
instead of snprintf(), or intended to use snprintf(), but typed 
Rprintf() out of habit.

I think the date-based snapshots made sense, that corresponded to how 
packages were tested and built together. I am afraid you cannot get 
close to that by choosing a single version. If you really must use only 
one, probably the latest.

If I wanted some reasonably reliable repeatability of computations, I 
would though keep a virtual machine snapshot with the matching OS, 
matching version of R, the packages installed (probably from source in 
case debugging became needed), and all external dependencies. Ideally 
with disconnected network to make sure the computation works fully 
locally, and as I would not be updating the OS, for security as well. I 
would keep that snapshot intact - never save the machine state again to 
it. And if possible convert it to several image formats just in case the 
virtualization software stops being supported or no longer can read 
certain formats.

Uri,

I can speak only for macOS package binaries and they have been rarely re-built. The only time when a re-build is necessary is when a dependency is updated and breaks its backward-compatibility (sadly, yes, that happens). It is relatively rare, but recently Matrix was one example with reasonably big fall-out. Those things are likely to happen more often in the future, but if you are mainly interested in an archive then you should be able to simply go by modification dates for the macOS binaries. However, I would add a black-out period after a major R release, because what happens is that I do a full re-build of all packages after a major R release (up til then the packages are build against the beta/RC) and that can take up to a few days, so I wouldn't keep packages built before that first set is done which can be few days after the release.

Cheers,
Simon

You could check on Winbuilder as that is a concrete setup used for 
incoming checks. But in principle, the computation may take longer 
because of changes in dependencies, external software and R. Which can 
be due to a performance regression, a bugfix, etc. Only 
debugging/profiling could reveal the true cause.

If you were close to the limit last time, it may be a coincidence and 
you might simply reduce the examples to be on the safe side.

Yes, it may even be some OS update, or just coincidence that the system 
was idling the last time your package got checked.
Note that CRAN systems are expected to be slower than, e.g., your 
laptop, as the servers use multi core CPUs with rather low frequencies.

Thank you, Duncan and Ivan for helpful feedback.
I reached out to the maintainer of the package, and she was able to quickly resolve the issue and resubmit.
Consequently my re-submission was accepted.

Kind regards,
Maxim Nazarov

Package maintainers recently got a message telling us not to use 
sprintf() any more.  I guess the minpack.lm maintainer either didn't 
read the whole message carefully enough and used Rprintf as a substitute 
instead of snprintf(), or intended to use snprintf(), but typed 
Rprintf() out of habit.

 If you had to choose one binary to preserve for a pkg, which would it be?

Hi list,

I received a few emails, some off list, and replied privately to all.  
Based on the feedback, I decided to modify the approach to replacing 
MRAN.
To those interested, the updated plan follows:

1) Mac and Windows binaries from MRAN will be saved in a new archive, 
which will be called "GRAN" (G is for groundhog).  GRAN will also 
continue collecting new binaries from CRAN and archiving them for the 
foreseeable future.

2) In general, a given package, version, OS file will be saved once in 
the archive, using the 1st file posted to CRAN for that 
package-version-os (but looking at CRAN at least 10 days after a major R 
release, to ensure it was built with the released R version). There are 
two exceptions to this single binary rule (see (3) and (4))

3) The top 2% of packages on CRAN, with the most reverse dependencies, 
will be saved every 1st of the month even if it is the same package 
version. This mitigates the consequences of a given already built  
binary becoming incompatible with other packages (for example the binary 
for MASS is saved again, every 1st of the month, even if the version has 
not changed)

4) When a Mac binary is rebuilt, since they are are seldom rebuilt, it 
will be assumed that something happened, and that package version binary 
will be saved again for all OS. For example, if on 2021/05/03 MASS was 
rebuilt for Mac, the version for Windows and arm mac will also be saved 
again. Just in case. This is essentially piggybacking on Simon Urbanek's 
decisions to rebuild binaries, it assumes they are often diagnostic of 
needing a new build.

5) The package groundhog will automatically select the relevant binary 
to install, based on this architecture. Users will continue to simply 
need to run:
groundhog.library(pkg, date)

6) Once everything is rolled out and running smoothly, i will explore 
adding ubuntu binaries to GRAN

This should generate a fairly robust, if necessarily imperfect , archive 
of binaries, with a manageable GB footprint (ballpark <3TB  for all 
packages since 2014), and maximal ease-of-use.

The selective copying of MRAN-->GRAN is  taking place now, the version 
of groundhog that benefits from it should be released around May, 
several weeks before Microsoft erases MRAN.

Thanks for your feedback so far, very happy to receive further 
suggestions or thoughts off list.

Best,

Uri

The only time when a re-build is necessary is when a dependency is updated and breaks its backward-compatibility (sadly, yes, that happens). It is relatively rare, but recently Matrix was one example with reasonably big fall-out. Those things are likely to happen more often in the future, but if you are mainly interested in an archive then you should be able to simply go by modification dates for the macOS binaries. However, I would add a black-out period after a major R release, because what happens is that I do a full re-build of all packages after a major R release (up til then the packages are build against the beta/RC) and that can take up to a few days, so I wouldn't keep packages built before that first set is done which can be few days after the release.

Greetings!

I submitted my USA.state.boundaries package on 6 January 2023 and Uwe 
responded back letting me know that it was over the 5 MB CRAN threshold. 
I responded back to Uwe letting him know that as of that date there were 
52 CRAN packages over 5 MB. As of today (29 January 2023), there are 
actually 53 CRAN packages over 5 MB.

As I heard no response back from Uwe, I re-submitted my 
USA.state.boundaries package on 12 January and 21 January. As of today, 
I have not heard any response back from Uwe or any other CRAN team 
volunteer.

There are 2 questions:

1) How long should it take to receive a response back from a CRAN team 
volunteer after a manual inspection of a CRAN package?

2) Why has my package been denied acceptance to CRAN while a new package 
over 5 MB has been allowed to be hosted on CRAN recently?

Thank you in advance.

   Out of curiosity, what was the recently added package?

   It looks like the previous version of your package from about a year 
ago is only a 1.2MB tarball.  Also out of curiosity, what caused the 
increase?

   cheers

My understanding is that packages over 5MB are only allowed under
exceptional circumstances. You would need to include a note in your
submission explaining why it is over 5 MB. If it is not accepted, then the
reason provided is not sufficient. I believe that the CRAN guidelines
actually state this, and there may even be Stack Exchange cases related to
this, as well.

Not sure about how long to wait for a response, but since the CRAN team is
made up of volunteers who have plenty of other things on their plates, I
always interpret a lack of response as meaning that I missed something
obvious.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Proper way to express Fortran 2008 dependence for R
 package
Message-ID: <CAL6gwnL+7q5wKkittHkO4GEq=ri5thUBEEjjY_q=C9nwOrnEeQ@mail.gmail.com>

I would like to convert some of my hand-rolled Fortran code to Fortran
intrinsics which entered the language in Fortran 2008, which should be
extremely widely supported at this time. Specifically, I would like to
use the log_gamma function and ieee_arithmetic functions and values.
If it helps, the current package is at [1] and devel branch with new
code is at [2].

If I understand it correctly, WRE allows for dependence on Fortran
2008 by explicitly passing -std=f2008 in PKG_FFLAGS (WRE section 1.2.3
Using F9x code [3]). However, checking a package as-cran with that
addition delivers a warning (further confirmed by win-builder and
rhub).

My question is is it appropriate to submit a package with that warning
and note it in the submission or is there a better way to express
reliance on Fortran 2008. The implication from WRE 1.2.4 is that
passing standards in Makevars is preferable to stating them in
DESCRIPTION, at least as regards C++.

What somewhat complicates matters is that if I build my package
(Rtools43 on Windows 10) without passing "-std=f2008" it still builds
properly and passes all the tests because Rtools43 is based on GCC12.2
which supports Fortran 2008 intrinsics. So I can probably submit it
without the flag, but someone with a very old Fortran installation may
suffer.

I understand being told I should just address CRAN directly, but I
thought I would try the collected institutional memory here first.

Thank you,

Avi

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Help with CRAN-only Windows-only package build error:
 System.Rd not found
Message-ID: <CAEbuDvJuzUn7JKdWeH6u8MtvETcMi4m3tvmZXtvQ3bSB8xGHpA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all, trying to troubleshoot my way through my first CRAN package
submission. I've addressed all the other issues so far (much thanks to Uwe
from CRAN for that).

In the second-to-last version I submitted via devtools::release(), it
raised 1 WARNING on both Windows and Debian:
* checking sizes of PDF files under 'inst/doc' ... WARNING
  'gs+qpdf' made some significant size reductions:
     compacted 'noise.pdf' from 1.4Mb to 1.1Mb

To address this, I re-released to CRAN with vignette compaction active:
devtools::release(args = "--compact-vignettes=gs+qpdf")

However, this now raises 1 new NOTE (only on Windows) and 1 ERROR. The NOTE
is:
* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... [7s] NOTE
Reading Rd files failed with
  cannot open the connection
Problems when formatting CITATION entries:
  cannot open file 'D:/RCompile/recent/R/share/Rd/macros/system.Rd': No
such file or directory

Which later produces the ERROR:
* checking whether package 'gcplyr' can be installed ... ERROR
Installation failed.
See 'd:/RCompile/CRANincoming/R-devel/gcplyr.Rcheck/00install.out' for
details.

If I check 00install.out, here's what I see:
* installing *source* package 'gcplyr' ...
** using staged installation

Execution halted
ERROR: lazy loading failed for package 'gcplyr'
* removing 'd:/RCompile/CRANincoming/R-devel/lib/gcplyr'
* restoring previous 'd:/RCompile/CRANincoming/R-devel/lib/gcplyr'

There were no changes to the code between two submissions, and when I
googled around to try to figure out what might be causing this error, I
couldn't find anything that would explain why a submission that was
successful other than a single too-large vignette pdf now raises an error
when the pdf's are compacted before submission.

The full package source code is available at
https://github.com/mikeblazanin/gcplyr.

Let me know if you have any ideas what could be causing this or what to
look into! This isn't an issue I've been able to reproduce on my local
machine nor on the rhub checker so it's a bit difficult for me to debug and
I don't want to take up any more of the CRAN volunteers' time

Thanks!

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Best current way to hook into the event loop?
Message-ID: <3e315cd1-d4fb-8bff-f801-7fad9eddbac5@gmail.com>

I'm updating low level stuff in the rgl package.  I'm exploring using 
the GLFW library to handle low level stuff instead of trying to do that 
myself.

Currently rgl has fairly ugly code to link into the R event loop.  (It 
needs to do this so that it hears about mouse movement, etc.)  I'm 
hoping that someone else has written better code than I could to do 
this.  Is there a currently recommended way to hook into the loop?

The kinds of things I need are getting events fairly frequently (e.g. 
0.03 second delay if things aren't too busy) for code that doesn't 
involve R at all.

I will also occasionally want to call back into R; I don't really mind 
if there's a bigger delay to wait for that to be safe.

I've seen the "later" package:  it looks as though it might do what I 
need, but the protection for R code seems to be all or nothing, i.e. if 
I want to evaluate an R expression nothing else can be running, or if I 
want action while R code is running, I can't involve R at all.

Duncan,

I don't know if it is best, but you can have a look at "background"[1] which is I believe what "later" was inspired by. It is a very minimal example so should give you ideas on how to do that in your package - it runs the R code on the main thread so it should be as close to safe as one can get with asynchronous calls, just beware of reentrance. In your case I suspect that you may already have an X11 fd that you can use in the unix handler - not sure what signaling you need on Windows, though.

Cheers,
Simon

Thanks.  Yours appears to have the advantage of being able to run R code 
in the middle of a function call if that function calls R_ProcessEvents, 
as Sys.sleep() does.  I wonder why "later" didn't support that?

What I was hoping for would be something like R_PolledEvents, but it 
should work on all systems, not just Unix-alikes.  My goal is to 
simplify rgl.  Part of this means I'd like to minimize the system 
dependence, since I no longer have easy access to a Windows machine for 
testing.

Message-ID: <CALECgPYrOi1dcS_LfyuW5A+DQqjmC5SxepVof0Q64oWbFdt_Lw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear List -

What?s the latest best practice on trying to reproduce warnings raised
on CRAN checks?

I updated my epanet2toolkit package earlier this week.
R CMD check ?as-cran was clean on RHUB and Winbuilder and my local
machines.  But on CRAN a few variations are causing warnings.

For example R-devel-debian-gcc is ok on rhub
https://builder.r-hub.io/status/epanet2toolkit_0.6.1.tar.gz-58c1ce1e316317307679f58450a5e17a

But
not on CRAN:
https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-gcc/epanet2toolkit-00check.html

Thanks in advance for any suggestions.

Brad

Message-ID: <BL0PR06MB4371458D1DC48087B8F6E780C6D79@BL0PR06MB4371.namprd06.prod.outlook.com>

Dear R-package-devel,

I am updating package mvmesh that is on CRAN.  I would like to split that package into two parts, mvmesh (multivariate meshes/grids) and mvhist (multivariate histograms). Does CRAN have a policy/practice on this?   I did  a search, but found nothing on this.

I would do this in two steps:

  1.  Extract some of the functions in the current package into a new package.   Submit that package as mvhist and wait for approval.
  2.  Remove the extracted functions from the current package, and submit it with a new version number.
There is a short term problem that some functions would exist in two places during the time period it takes to do step 2.  After that, users who want to use the functions in mvhist will have install both packages.

I don't want to add work for the CRAN team, so please let me know if this is forbidden or there is a better way.

Thanks,  John

I think your plan is good, though it is missing one step that should 
happen between 1 and 2:

Contact maintainers of all packages that use mvmesh and tell them what 
changes they need to make.  According to the CRAN page for mvmesh, 
that's just two packages, both of which you maintain:  gensphere, 
SphericalCubature, but you may know of others (e.g. on Bioconductor or 
elsewhere) who should be informed.

If those are the only two, then the step should be to send any necessary 
updates to them before proceeding to step 2.  When you do get to step 2, 
mention what steps you took to inform mvmesh users.

You will get these warnings if you do things like
    char *string = (char*)malloc(length);
    snprintf(string, sizeof(string), "format ...");
sizeof(string) here is 8 (on a 64 bit machine), no matter what length is.

Change this to either
   char string[64] // 64 had better be big enough
   snprintf(string, sizeof(string), "format ..");
or
   char *string = (char*)malloc(length);
   snprintf(string, length, "format ...");

 Proper way to express Fortran 2008 dependence for R package

For closure, I was advised by Professor Ripley to both pass
"-std=f008" in Makevars and add "SystemRequirements: A version of
gfortran supporting Fortran 2008" to the DESCRIPTION. CRAN accepted
the package with those two changes. I also note that the R Daily News
of 2023-02-03 [1] has the following entry under "R-devel": ?check?'s
?checking compilation flags in Makevars? has been relaxed to accept
the use of flags such as ?-std=f2008? in ?PKG_FFLAGS?. Hopefully, this
means future packages will have an easier time relying on more modern
features, albeit they are 5 or 15 years old by now :).

Thank you,

Avi

Ben, thank you for your response.

The text2sdg package was added on 24 January 2023.

I had created a drat repository called USA.state.boundaries.data to 
store the full set of maps (1 of which is needed for my iemisc package) 
and I had only a subset of the maps in the USA.state.boundaries package 
which appears on CRAN.

In order to submit the revised iemisc package to CRAN, I had to add the 
map data set from USA.state.boundaries.data which iemisc requires for 
key functions to the USA.state.boundaries package. I first tried to 
submit the revised USA.state.boundaries package with the map that iemisc 
requires to CRAN back in December 2022. I exchanged some e-mails with 
Uwe prior to the holiday break.

Hey Rich, thank you for your response.

In my case, I explained the reasoning to justify the 
USA.state.boundaries package being over 5 MB and why it is needed by 
iemisc, including providing previous e-mail discussions between Uwe and 
myself, on the various re-submittals of the USA.state.boundaries 
package.

Part of the reason why I wrote the e-mail to this list serve is that I 
have seen Uwe respond back to e-mail threads in this R-pkg-devel list, 
but I have not received any response from him nor any other CRAN 
volunteer since 6 January (almost a month as of today, 3 February 2023).

I responded back to Uwe on 6 January 2023.

In terms of Uwe and others being volunteers, I understand that 
completely. I myself volunteer on a variety of projects and I do a 
variety of projects for pay as well & I have done that for a couple of 
decades now.

I believe that a response should be made in less than a month's time.

Irucka

Speaking of reproducing the warnings, the CRAN checks pass -Wall
-Wstrict-prototypes -pedantic to the compiler, while on Rhub, only the
UB sanitizer is used without any statical analysis warning flags.

It may be possible to see the extra warnings if you set CFLAGS = -Wall

As complement to Duncan's nice answer I also suggest to use the function .Deprecated() for an additional transition time.
(see eg https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44622054/mark-a-function-as-deprecated-in-customised-r-package)

Baseline, if other people/packages use your package, alert them (via a message/warning due to .Deprecated()) and give them time to adopt...

I think your plan is good, though it is missing one step that should 
happen between 1 and 2:

Contact maintainers of all packages that use mvmesh and tell them what 
changes they need to make.  According to the CRAN page for mvmesh, 
that's just two packages, both of which you maintain:  gensphere, 
SphericalCubature, but you may know of others (e.g. on Bioconductor or 
elsewhere) who should be informed.

If those are the only two, then the step should be to send any necessary 
updates to them before proceeding to step 2.  When you do get to step 2, 
mention what steps you took to inform mvmesh users.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] How to update "SystemRequirements: C++11"?
Message-ID: <CAFOpNVFTGcrsURZC9TOv=KSceKr_WFPsMV0TJoCZKrppkkSFdw@mail.gmail.com>

I recently submitted a package to CRAN with "SystemRequirements: C++11".
This raises the following NOTE on R-devel, and I was asked to fix and
resubmit:

* checking C++ specification ... NOTE
  Specified C++11: please update to current default of C++17

If I understand correctly, I have two options, neither of which will work:
1. Remove "SystemRequirements: C++11" entirely. The problem with this is
that on systems with older versions of R (3.6 and below, I believe), it may
try to compile the package with an older C++ standard, which will fail.
2. Update it to "SystemRequirements: C++17". The problem here is that on
systems that don't have a C++17 compiler, the package won't build -- even
though the package only actually requires a C++11 compiler.

How should I deal with this?

Are you allowed to say "C++11 or C++17"?

Actually I can partially answer this:  the test is not based on 
SystemRequirements, but on the log of the build, which now contains 
lines like this:

   using C compiler: ?Apple clang version 12.0.0 (clang-1200.0.32.28)?
   using C++ compiler: ?Apple clang version 12.0.0 (clang-1200.0.32.28)?
   using C++11
   using SDK: ?MacOSX11.1.sdk?

I get "using C++11" because of this line in Makevars:

   CXX_STD = CXX11

So I guess the answer is to change your Makevars to make that line 
conditional on running under an old version of R.  If you figure out how 
to do that, could you post the recipe here?

One way to resolve that conundrum could be to add a configure script
that detects a C++17/C++14/C++11 compiler known to R and sets that in
Makevars. I haven't published an update on CRAN yet, but R CMD check
seems satisfied with this under multiple versions of R between 3.3 and
R-devel:

I believe this is closely related to this email [1]. Dirk and I and
Aymeric have been going through the same issue with nloptr as well.
Our current opinion is to leave it out, as it would restrict more
users to demand C++17, which is unneeded, than to have users with over
a decade old compiler which does not have C++11. Dirk and Aymeric,
please chime in if I have misstated. Regardless, according to
Professor Ripley, if you require specific features, you should mark
them in _both_ Makevars and SystemRequirements, which is implied in
the "r-devel" version of WRE which adds the words "also" in section
1.2.4.

Thanks,

Avi

Could you please point to the specific passage? According to [1],
section 1.2.4, declaring the C++ standard in SystemRequirements is
only mandatory for C++17 or later.

That doesn't refer to the SystemRequirements field.

No, but the prior sentence does. The complete excerpt is:

  ::Packages without a src/Makevars or src/Makefile file may specify a
C++ standard for code in the src directory by including something like
?C++14? in the ?SystemRequirements? field of the DESCRIPTION file,
e.g.
  ::::SystemRequirements: C++14
 ::If a package does have a src/Makevars[.win] file then also setting
the make variable ?CXX_STD? there is recommended, as it allows R CMD
SHLIB to work correctly in the package?s src directory.

So one is supposed to add the requirement to DESCRIPTION via
SystemRequitements. If there is a Makevars, one should ALSO set the
variable in there.

If you wish, I can forward you personal communication with Professor
Ripley from last week where he makes this clear as well.

Thanks,

Avi

After reading the discussion here and the manuals, I think this is how 
to do it.  I'm assuming your code is compatible with both C++11 and 
C++17, but not some earlier standards.

1.  In SystemRequirements, state that it needs C++11 or higher.  That 
field is supposed to be human readable (though I think there are scripts 
that try to read it; maybe they will suggest a particular wording to use).

2.  Have a configure script (e.g. like the one Ivan posted) that 
specifies CXX_STD=CXX11 in Makevars if the R version is less than 4.0.0, 
and gives no specification otherwise (because from 4.0.0 onwards, if C++ 
is available, it will be C++11 or higher).

I think it wouldn't hurt to look through the available versions and pick 
from them, but I don't think it's supposed to be necessary.

If it eventually turns out that your code is not compatible with some 
later standard, I'm sure CRAN will let you know.

Now that I think about it some more, I think I can do the following:

1. In the DESCRIPTION file, remove "SystemRequirements: C++11". I believe
this field is used only for R CMD check, not for actually installing
packages. CRAN only runs R CMD check on r-oldrel, r-release, and r-devel,
and all of those versions (4.1, 4.2, and 4.3) have C++11. For older
versions of R, the package might not pass R CMD check, but it will still
install (provided there's a C++11 compiler).

2. In my case, I think I can skip the configure script. This is because I
also have GNU Make as a requirement, and it allows you to conditionally set
the CXX_STD variable only when R < 4.0, by putting this in the Makevars
file:

R_VERSION=$(shell $(R_HOME)/bin/Rscript --vanilla -e 'if (getRversion()<4)
cat("lt4") else cat("ge4")')
ifeq ($(R_VERSION), lt4)
CXX_STD=CXX11
endif

No need. But with all due respect, in such a case, I do not agree with
Prof. Ripley. By no means I'm a native English speaker, but I'm quite
accustomed to the "MAY, SHOULD, MUST" language that is common in
software guidelines. And there is a clear "may" in the first sentence,
implying that you may, or may not, add this to SystemRequirements.
Therefore, with the current wording, adding the standard to
SystemRequirements is only mandatory in the case in which your minimum
supported version is above the default (which makes sense to me, BTW).

If this was meant to be always mandatory, I would suggest to the
authors of WRE to modify that section.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] R OpenCL on an AMD GPU
Message-ID: <cc5f12ed-0df3-9c27-842c-7ebc2dd5b5a9@gmx.de>

Hi,

I am trying to set up the CRAN package "OpenCL" to run on a Windows 10
machine with an AMD GPU (Radeon 7900 XTX).

I installed the AMD drivers (which carry the OpenCL.dll) and the
installation of OpenCL in R didnt work. So I also downloaded the AMD SDK
to set up the environment variables OCL64LIB, OCL32LIB and OCLINC. The
installation worked, but the built package was broke (OpenCL kernels
didnt execute due to a multiplicity of errors - the OpenCL set up must
have been wrong).

The installation of OpenCL was done with install.packages("OpenCL",
INSTALL_opts = "--no-test-load") trying it with and without the
install_opts option.

Does anyone have a clue?

Best regards,

Quirin

Quirin,

this is a contributed package question, so you should either use the GitHub issues (https://github.com/s-u/OpenCL/issues) for the package or contact the maintainer (me). But before you do so, you have to provide a lot more details including exact code you used and the full output of the errors you saw. Finally, on Windows, make sure you refer to the instructions posted here to pre-load your run-time DLL: https://github.com/s-u/OpenCL/issues/6#issuecomment-899114747

Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Problem with package containing spatial data
Message-ID: <CAHGVjrktvXFs=RA+sMTQiKTq=4v91wtt8tAAU2Y8ALWOJ=R4xA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'm developing a package that contains spatial data about public safety in
Rio de Janeiro.

The problem is that when I use the usethis::use_data function which
transforms the shapefile data into a file with the .rda extension, I cannot
use the geometry attribute to create a map.

E.g.:

# Raw-data script:

spatial_aisp <- sf::st_read('data-raw/shp_aisp/lm_aisp_2019.shp')

plot(spatial_aisp) # works

# Same data from .rda file after use usethis::use_data(spatial_aisp,
overwrite = TRUE)

x <- ispdata::spatial_aisp

plot(x) # do not work

Error message:
Error in data.matrix(x) :
  'list' object cannot be coerced to type 'double'


This is happening with all spatial data in the package. I'm using lazydata:
true and have already disabled file compression options, but the problem
persists.

Any ideas?

Scripts can be accessed at https://github.com/igorlaltuf/ispdata

Thanks!

I found that this strategy doesn't work. It turns out that R detects the
C++ version by simply grepping for CXX_STD in  the Makevars file, so even
with my fancy ifeq() statement, it still thinks that the package uses C++11.

So now my plan is to simply remove "CXX_STD" from Makevars and
"SystemRequirements: C++11" from DESCRIPTION. My understanding is that this
will cause the package to no longer build on R 3.5, but as of R 3.6.2,
C++11 became the default, so it should build on that version of R or higher.

Hi, I want to share the following information due to some of the 
feedback that I received with regards to the extreme lag on getting a 
response to my USA.state.boundaries package submissions.

The following text is taken verbatim from 
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html:

Submission

...

In more detail:

...

Once uploaded, no further submissions of that package should be made 
whilst the uploaded version is pending processing (which may take a few 
days) and you have not received a reply from a CRAN maintainer.




There is no question here, I just want to share information that will 
hopefully be useful to all of the R developers.

Thank you.

Hi Igor,
I?ve a couple packages that have spatial data in them that I maintain. I?ve opted to package up the data as a geopackage file and import it as an {sf} object. Edzer Pebesma suggests this to circumvent changes in the {sf} package from affecting native {sf} objects that are distributed as part of a package. Maybe this is an option for you?

In https://github.com/adamhsparks/extractOz, see /inst/extdata for the geopackage file and https://github.com/adamhsparks/extractOz/blob/main/R/data.R for handling the data importing and making available in the R session on package load.

Best,
Adam

Does this break in a new R session, but start working when you load the
sf namespace? I think that your package needs to depend on sf in order
for this to work. Specifying it in Imports may be enough to make the
plot.sf S3 method available to the user.

You may encounter other problems if you go this way, like R CMD check
complaining that you don't use the package you're importing. Loading
the data from a file on demand would also load the sf namespace and
thus solve the problem.

Specifying a package in the Imports field of DESCRIPTION guarantees that 
it will be available to load, but doesn't load it.  Importing something 
from it via the NAMESPACE triggers a load, as does executing code like 
pkg::fn, or explicitly calling loadNamespace("pkg"), or loading a 
package that does one of these things.

Hi Igor,

I had the same issue using terra rather than sf a couple of weeks ago.

I thought of solving the issue as follow:


   1.

   store the shapefiles under extdata.
   2.

   create a function that loads the files:

.build_internal_files <- function() {
  ## This function should not be called by the user.
  ## It performs the lazy loading of the data since terra cannot
handle rda files
  assign("CountryBorders",
terra::vect(system.file("extdata/CountryBorders.shp", package =
"IsoriX")), envir = as.environment("package:IsoriX"))
  assign("OceanMask", terra::vect(system.file("extdata/OceanMask.shp",
package = "IsoriX")), envir = as.environment("package:IsoriX"))
}


   1. call that function automatically upon attach using .onAttach():

.onAttach <- function(libname, pkgname) {
    .build_internal_files() ## lazy loading of the internal data
}

It seems to work...

Note that .onAttach() is a standard way of defining a function that is
recognised by R and ran when the package is attached.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] CRAN Vignette pdfs garbled in Firefox pdf viewer
Message-ID: <CAEbuDvKgn6YQM9LZRozRP_hzU0RXZEjVoPY4VVJu58xaMZrmvA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all, my package gcplyr has several vignettes which, from CRAN, appear
garbled when opened with Firefox's pdf viewer (
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gcplyr/index.html). Specifically,
instead of regular characters, there are numerous black-outlined white
boxes with text inside like "EO 88" or "EO 55". This doesn't occur with the
pdf vignettes on Github (https://github.com/mikeblazanin/gcplyr/). This
also doesn't occur when CRAN pdfs are opened with Chrome's pdf viewer or
Microsoft Edge's pdf viewer, nor when files are downloaded from CRAN and
opened with a local pdf viewer.

The issue was documented here:

Thank you all for your help.

Adam, I followed your suggestion, but I still can't figure out why the data
is only available locally when I run the devtools::load_all() function.

When I install the package from GitHub, the data does not appear (even
using the data() function).

Extdata: https://github.com/igorlaltuf/ispdata/tree/main/inst/extdata
Import: https://github.com/igorlaltuf/ispdata/blob/main/R/spatial_cisp.R

And is there any way to reduce the size of files in gpkg format? The
package increased from 5 to 10 megabytes. I tried to make it smaller with
the function sf::st_write("inst/extdata/spatial_aisp.gpkg", compress =
"deflate", append = F), but the size remained the same.

Thanks again for all the help.

I don't see a problem in Firefox 109.0.1 on a Mac.  Maybe the "0.1" is a 
bug fix?  Or maybe I looked in the wrong place.  Could you be very 
specific, i.e. URL, page, line.

Would these files ever be used when your package is not attached, e.g. 
through a function imported by a different package?  If so, you should 
use .onLoad(), not .onAttach().

Hi,

I can't read any vignettes of gcplyr in Firefox 109.0.1 from a Windows 10.
But sorry, I don't have any solution.

This is apparently  due to compression as needed fort package building, e.g., R CMD build --compact-vignettes=both --md5 --resave-data --log gap so mine has the same problem: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gap/vignettes/jss.pdf

Hi all, my package gcplyr has several vignettes which, from CRAN, appear
garbled when opened with Firefox's pdf viewer (
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gcplyr/index.html). Specifically,
instead of regular characters, there are numerous black-outlined white
boxes with text inside like "EO 88" or "EO 55". This doesn't occur with the
pdf vignettes on Github (https://github.com/mikeblazanin/gcplyr/). This
also doesn't occur when CRAN pdfs are opened with Chrome's pdf viewer or

opened with a local pdf viewer.

The issue was documented here:
https://github.com/mikeblazanin/gcplyr/issues/112

Anyone have any suggestions for what could be causing this?

Thanks!
Mike Blazanin

I reported the bug to bugzilla.

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1816128

The bug is already fixed.
We should use higher version of firefox or firefox nightly.

The problem has been around for a while for me and thank you for raising it -- esp. with a fix!

The bug is already fixed.
We should use higher version of firefox or firefox nightly.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] CRAN Vignette pdfs garbled in Firefox pdf viewer

Hi all, my package gcplyr has several vignettes which, from CRAN, appear
garbled when opened with Firefox's pdf viewer (
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gcplyr/index.html). Specifically,
instead of regular characters, there are numerous black-outlined white
boxes with text inside like "EO 88" or "EO 55". This doesn't occur with the
pdf vignettes on Github (https://github.com/mikeblazanin/gcplyr/). This
also doesn't occur when CRAN pdfs are opened with Chrome's pdf viewer or

opened with a local pdf viewer.

The issue was documented here:
https://github.com/mikeblazanin/gcplyr/issues/112

Anyone have any suggestions for what could be causing this?

Thanks!
Mike Blazanin

Hi, I am attempting to build my revised 'iemisc' package, but I am 
having trouble building one of the vignettes.

I am receiving the following error message:

* creating vignettes ...Error in find_vignette_product(name, by = 
"weave", dir = docdir, engine = engine) :
   Failed to locate ?weave? output file ?Engineering_Survey_Examples.pdf? 
or ?Engineering_Survey_Examples.html? for vignette with name 
?Engineering_Survey_Examples? and engine ?knitr::rmarkdown?.


This is odd because the following command correctly produces the PDF of 
the document:

library("rmarkdown")
render("/vignettes/Engineering_Survey_Examples.Rmd", 
pdf_document(latex_engine = "xelatex"))

I have attached the .Rmd file for the vignette to this e-mail.

Thank you.

Hi all. I uncovered the error that caused the vignette not to print.

It had to do with one of the functions in the vignette.

Thank you.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Unable to load Windows NETIO.SYS and WINSPOOL.DRV DLLs
Message-ID: <eb7d1d333a2797d098418d092f19bd4f3542ce51.camel@ed.ac.uk>

[I've posted this to r-devel, and just realised that I should have
posted it to this list instead - apologies to those on both lists for
the extra email.]

I am trying to build the RGtk2 package
(https://github.com/lawremi/RGtk2) using R-devel and only the libraries
bundled with RTookl4.3 (currently RGtk2 is bundled with a compiled dll
and requires GTK libraries to be downloaded after installation into R).

I have used the instructions at
https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/howto-R-4.2.html
to create a Makevars.win file (appended, including description of how
the PKG_LIBS have been set).

The package can be installed, but the shared object created can't be
loaded:

   > library(RGtk2)
   Error in inDL(x, as.logical(local), as.logical(now), ...) :
     unable to load shared object 'C:/Users/David
   Sterratt/AppData/Local/R/win-library/4.3/RGtk2/libs/x
   64/RGtk2.dll':
     LoadLibrary failure:  The specified module could not be found.

WinDbg output reveals errors loading "NETIO.SYS" and "WINSPOOL.DRV"
when running "library(RGtk2)":

   0c64:0640 @ 44312812 - LdrpProcessWork - ERROR: Unable to load DLL:

   ...
   0c64:1e5c @ 44312812 - LdrpProcessWork - ERROR: Unable to load DLL:

"C:\Users\David Sterratt\AppData\Local\R\win-
library\4.3\RGtk2\libs\x64\RGtk2.dll", Parent Module: "(null)", Status:
0xc0000135

I'm stuck at this point: I'm not a regular Windows User, and I've not
been able to find any trustworthy advice online about how to deal with
missing DLLs. Any help would be appreciated.

There is an issue on Github about this issue with full output from
WinDbg:
https://github.com/lawremi/RGtk2/issues/9

Best wishes,

David

The failure to load WINSPOOL.DRV is perplexing (it should normally be
possible to load as it's a system DLL that applications are supposed to
link against in order to be able to print), but NETIO.SYS should
probably be absent from the import list. At least it seems to be linked
against some kernel-related stuff that shouldn't be reachable from
userspace applications.

By removing -lnetio from PKG_LIBS, I was able to load the package and
run some example code from the JSS article, but then Rgui.exe crashed
on exit. I'm running R-4.2.2 and Rtools43 on a Windows 7 machine, which
could also be a source of the difference.

Does the Dependency Walker <https://dependencywalker.com/> provide you
any useful information about the package DLL besides what you already
know? (Some warnings deep in the dependency tree are to be expected.
R.DLL is not on the PATH so won't be automatically found, but other
dependencies should exist.)

Note that Gtk2 is end of life, Gtk4 was released 3 years ago already.
There are reasons why neither the former RGtk2 maintainer nor the CRAN 
team decided to maintain RGtk2 further on.

Thank you. I know that Gtk2 is end-of-life, but I was thinking that the
inclusion of the Gtk2 library in RTools4.3 meant that it was still seen
as usable. I have an R package that is built around the gWidgets2RGtk2
interface  - it had some features that the Tcl/Tk interface didn't
have.

Anyway, *supposing* that someone wanted to investigate updating RGtk2
to RGtk4 and upload the updated package to CRAN, what would be the
possible approaches (if any) to include the RGtk4 libraries, so that
the package could be compiled on the CRAN build servers? Either (1)
include the Gtk4 source code (and any necessary dependencies) in the R
package; or (2) have RGtk4 dev libraries installed on build servers
(I'm assuming that they are not currently installed).

Best wishes,

David

Thank you for looking at this. I tried removing -lnetio, but package
didn't install at all on Windows 10.

I looked at the Dependency Walker, but it was giving me many messages
about missing DLLs with names like:

  API-MS-WIN-CORE-STRING-L2-1-0.DLL  Error opening file. The system
cannot find the file specified (2).

These libraries seem to be part of the UCRT system. However, when
looked at the DLL of a package that *did* load in Dependency Walker, I
got the same messages, so I think the path to the UCRT files may be
missing.

Dependency Walker did seem to find:

  c:\windows\system32\WINSPOOL.DRV

For NETIO.SYS it gave the " Error opening file. The system cannot find
the file specified (2)." There was also this table in the output.

     [ ? ] NETIO.SYS

If you're really interested, I can send you the output, but from what
Uwe says, I'm wondering if this is a lost cause!

Best wishes,

David.

If you need some details, perhaps simply ask Michael Lawrence.
He certainly knows better than most readers what the issues are, or at 
least were when RGtk2 got archived.

For reference, there is an old patch for RGtk2 package that I had 
created when working on Rtools42, though I am not very optimistic it 
will help in this case:

https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/r_packages/old_patches/CRAN/RGtk2.diff

I've added gtk2 libraries to Rtools42 as they were needed by a CRAN 
package (RGtk2) at that time and available in MXE. Now MXE has gtk3, but 
not gtk4.

If there is a need for gtk4 in a CRAN package, the best way forward 
would be to contribute gtk4 build configuration to MXE, ideally also 
after testing it builds as part of Rtools43 (which is a subset of MXE 
but with some updates not yet upstream). We could then replace gtk2 by 
gtk4 in Rtools. CRAN servers will then get gtk4 simply via updating Rtools.

This is only what would be needed for Windows. For macOS, gtk4 would 
have to be added to the recipes. For Linux, the package should work with 
gtk4 distributions available in main distributions.

If you wanted to use gtk from a package, perhaps it would be easier to 
try directly, not via the archived RGtk2 package.
